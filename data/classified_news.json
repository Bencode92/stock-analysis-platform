The upside was fueled by strong demand for new footwear launches, a bright spot under new CEO Elliott Hill’s early leadership as he works to revitalize the brand.</p>\n<p>However, optimism was short-lived after CFO Matthew Friend signaled a mid-teens percentage decline in Q4 sales, steeper than the 12.2% drop expected by analysts. The company also warned that discounting efforts to clear excess inventory could further weigh on fourth-quarter performance.</p>\n<p>The update triggered a sharp reversal in sentiment, as investors digested the impact of continued demand softness, especially in key markets. In Q3, overall revenue fell 9%, with North American sales plunging 21% to $1.1 billion, and Greater China revenue dropping a staggering 42% to $421 million.</p>\n<p>Despite exceeding profit expectations this quarter, Nike is clearly navigating a challenging retail environment, with regional headwinds and margin pressures clouding its near-term outlook.</p>\n",
