The Nasdaq Composite still closed up about 1% to 20,167.91 while the S&amp;P 500 index finished the day 0.80% higher at 6,141.02. Big Tech Downgrade 12:55 pm by Gerelyn Terzo While Tesla stock received a ringing endorsement from Wall Street analysts today, Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is seeing the other side of the spectrum. JPMorgan analysts lowered their price target on the iPhone maker to $230 from $240, keeping their &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on the stock. The analysts are worried about demand for the iPhone 17. Apple shares are lower by 0.79% today. The Nasdaq Composite is now up 0.70%. Benchmark Bullish on TSLA 11:01 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street research firm Benchmark is bullish on EV leader Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA).

This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are showing off as stocks come within grasp of their latest all-time high levels. With the strikes between Israel and Iran seemingly behind, the markets have reason for optimism and they are taking it. All three of the major stock market averages are in the green out of the gate, including a 0.40% advance in the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite. The S&amp;P 500 is eyeing its latest all-time high of 2025, which is in the ballpark of 6,147, its early 2025 intraday high level. After Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) clinched a new record high of approximately $156 per share, bullish sentiment has enveloped technology stocks for the most part. On the economic front, the economy slowed at a steeper pace than originally expected in Q1 2025. U.S. GDP declined by 0.5% in Q1 compared to original estimates of a 0.2% contraction. As the data continues to flow in, the Commerce Department downwardly revised results in areas such as consumer spending and exports.

      "title": "I’m 55 with $2.5 million in Apple stock- can I use these capital gains for the first 5 years of my retirement?",
      "content": "Planning for retirement is a complicated process that can take years to wrap your head around. Having millions of dollars in stock is incredibly fortunate, but it also poses some hard-to-answer questions. One Reddit user shared his situation: he is 55 years old and has owned Apple stock for 30 years, which is now worth $2.5 million. He would like to sell and use these funds for his retirement. The predicament is that doing so will result in significant tax payments and may raise his Medicare premiums. We are all aware that the higher an individual’s Modified Adjusted Gross Income, the higher one must pay in taxes. Because capital gains count towards MAGI, these funds can bump you into a higher tax bracket. This tax is unavoidable; however, there are certain strategies that can help reduce the financial stress. This slideshow presents several different options for how retirees can approach the burdens associated with capital gains, including tax-loss harvesting, Qualified Opportunity Funds, and donor-advised funds. These methods can minimize taxes and maximize retirement income. We explore how smart financial planning can give you peace of mind and protect your future. A Good Problem to Have: Capital Gains Dilemma A 55-year-old investor holds $2.5 million in Apple stock bought 30 years ago. Most of the value is in capital gains, raising tax concerns for retirement. What Are MAGI and Capital Gains? Selling appreciated stock increases Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI). A higher MAGI can push retirees into higher tax brackets and Medicare premiums. 2025 Capital Gains Tax Brackets Long-term capital gains tax rates are 0%, 15%, or 20%, based on filing status. For singles, 0% applies up to $48,350; for joint filers, up to $96,700. Impact on Medicare Costs Higher MAGI triggers IRMAA, increasing Medicare Part B and D premiums. Avoiding sudden large gains can help remain under IRMAA thresholds. Strategy 1: Spread Out the Gains Sell shares gradually over several years to manage taxable income. Spreading gains can help avoid higher tax and Medicare brackets. Strategy 2: Giving to Charities Donating appreciated stock to a donor-advised fund reduces taxable income. This strategy supports causes while minimizing tax burden. Strategy 3: Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts Early IRA withdrawals or Roth conversions can offset future taxes. Balancing withdrawals with stock sales can reduce overall tax impact. Strategy 4: Use Qualified Opportunity Funds Reinvesting in a Qualified Opportunity Fund can defer taxes. These funds often invest in real estate or development zones. Strategy 5: Consider RMDs Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) begin at age 73. Planning ahead ensures smoother income and lower tax rates later. Creating a Tax Strategy The best mix of strategies depends on the retiree’s goals and timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor ensures the right approach.

      "title": "“My Plan to Transition to Living Off Dividends Before Retirement”",
      "content": "For many people, there isn&#8217;t a ton of familiarity with dividends, even though they can be a critical part of a portfolio strategy. If you happen to visit r/dividends on Reddit, you will see and learn all about how both retirees and those looking for passive income are making dividends work for them in any number of ways. Key Points There is a lot of movement shifting toward relying on dividends for passive income during retirement. There is a big question about how much of a yield percentage you really want and need for dividend income. A whole subreddit is dedicated to the subject of dividends giving a lot advice. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) In the case of one Redditor, who is yet another poster in r/dividends, there is an important question about how retirees are making dividend income work. For this individual, they want to be well-prepared with a strategy before leaving the workforce, and as someone who is primarily a growth investor, they want to learn everything. The Current Portfolio This Redditor makes it perfectly clear that they have long considered themselves a growth investor. As a result, their current portfolio spread only has around 20% of investments focused on dividends, while the rest is focused more on growth. They are currently earning only around a 2% annual dividend yield on their total portfolio, a figure they aim to increase as they approach retirement. The goal is to be heavily focused on dividends as an income strategy for retirement, and the Redditor is asking others in the subreddit how they are breaking up their portfolios to accomplish something similar. As a reminder, a dividend yield is a ratio that indicates how much a company pays out in dividends each year to its stock price. Other Redditors Respond It won&#8217;t come as any surprise to learn that other Redditors who visit r/dividends regularly started chiming in with their thoughts quickly. Unsurprisingly, the top-ranked comment in the Redditor&#8217;s post was almost spot on with what this individual needed to hear. Based on their holdings, they have a strong account that includes both dividend-paying stocks and growth stocks, such as Google, Amazon, Apple, NVIDIA, and others. Additionally, there are nearly two dozen dividend growth and income stocks to help create this portfolio. The thing is, this Redditor isn’t alone, as many different responses in this post highlight purchases like SPYI, JEPI, QQQI, SPYH, QQQH, and many others. If you spend even a few minutes searching through this comment section and other posts in the sub, you&#8217;ll find that these are pretty standard holdings among those living off dividends or using these investments as dividend income right now. Additionally, other individuals claim to earn around $50,000 per year in dividend income, which is precisely what the original poster wanted to hear. This commenter highlighted their desire to reach around $150,000 annually, a not impossible amount of money if they have enough capital to buy the right number of shares. The Best Advice The best advice for this Redditor is to increase their dividend investments as they approach retirement age gradually. First things first, they need to know exactly what kind of income they are looking to earn annually and then work backwards to start picking out a portfolio. From here, they can also consider ETFs that prioritize dividends, creating a reliable income stream that can be used as a source of income during retirement. If the Redditor does go down this road, which sounds likely based on their comments, they simply need to regularly monitor their portfolio to ensure the yield stays in line with their income and retirement needs. Unfortunately, unlike investing directly in growth stocks, dividend yields as income are not a set-it-and-forget-it kind of thing. Instead, you have to rebalance the portfolio as needed to ensure you are getting what you need. The Redditor will also need to consider how to handle any tax implications related to the dividend income, alongside other income sources, including Social Security and capital gains.

      "title": "My Top 3 ETF’s I Would Put $10,000 In Today",
      "content": "Key Points Looking for high-yield ETFs? These three popular ETFs will never disappoint you. Each ETF is highly diversified, low-cost, low risk and pays steady dividends. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Market volatility in 2025 has driven investors towards safer assets like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). By investing in ETFs, you not only build a highly diversified portfolio but also generate steady income and hold some of the top companies. You do not have to pick individual stocks to make money. ETFs are a low-cost option of investing in stocks and they reduce company-specific risks. If you’re looking for the best ETFs to invest in this year, I’ve identified 3 where I’d put my $10,000 today. Since no two funds are equal, you need to weigh each based on your personal financial goals and risk appetite. JP Morgan Equity Premium ETF The J.P. Morgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI) is a covered call ETF that invests in the top S&amp;P 500 stocks. These stocks are known for little risk and steady returns. It offers a monthly payout and invests in the top U.S. blue-chip companies. The ETF enjoys an attractive 30-day SEC yield of 11.38% and holds 126 stocks. Since it is a covered call ETF, the fund buys stocks and then sells call options on them, this gives the buyers a chance to make a profit. While investors get a share in some profits, most are drawn to the high dividend yield. JEPI has an expense ratio of 0.35% and its NAV is $56.04. The ETF has remained flat in the year but the dividend yield makes it worth a consideration. Since it owns elite names and holds dividend-paying companies, it ensures a steady income for investors. Its holdings include: Information Technology: 15.8% Financials: 13% Industrials: 12.8% Healthcare: 11.3% The ETF also owns some of the Magnificent Seven, namely, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla. None of the stocks have a weightage higher than 2%. Despite investing the majority of the funds in the tech sector, JEPI reduces the sector-specific risks with its highly diversified portfolio. Even if the ETF moves sideways in the short term, investors can benefit from the steady passive income. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF If you are looking for a fund that is not tech-heavy, the Schwab U.S. Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD) is a smart choice. The fund offers the potential for income and growth. It holds 103 stocks and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 index. It has an expense ratio of 0.06% and a 30-day SEC yield of 3.81%. While the ETF has a slightly lower dividend yield, it offers capital appreciation. The NAV of the fund is $26.90 and it is up 4.38% in 12 months and over 50% in five years. The fund holdings include: Energy: 21.08% Consumer staples: 19.06% Healthcare: 15.68% Industrials: 12.45% None of the stocks in the ETF have a weightage higher than 5% and the top holdings include popular names like Cisco, ConocoPhillips, Texas Instruments, Coca-Cola, and Chevron Corporation. These are some of the dividend-paying companies. If you’re a passive income investor looking for a low-risk investment option, SCHD is a great choice. The ETF offers a wide range of top-quality dividend stocks to help build your passive income portfolio. SCHD isn’t tech-heavy, meaning you do not have to worry about your returns during volatility. The highly diversified portfolio owns elite names and pay quarterly dividends. JP Morgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF The JP Morgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ: JEPQ) invests in the Nasdaq 100 and holds stocks that have little volatility. It holds 108 stocks and has a 30-day SEC yield of 14.47%. JEPQ has an expense ratio of 0.35% and focuses heavily on tech. The fund holdings include: Information technology: 42.4% Other: 16.5% Communication services: 12.9% Consumer discretionary: 12.1% I believe that the future is tech and by investing in JEPQ, it is possible to reduce the company-specific risks while holding the top tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft. The top 10 stocks in the fund form 44.34% of the portfolio and these are tech companies except for Costco. The tech sector has rallied in the past and once the economy improves, we could see it pick pace again. JEPQ has an NAV of $52.59 and is down 4.87% in 12 months. Since the fund focuses on high yield, the capital appreciation could be limited. However, I believe the fund has the potential to keep rewarding investors with a solid yield. JEPI and JEPQ both have a solid dividend yield and the fund is handled by the experts at JP Morgan, making it low-risk and highly reliable. JEPQ pays monthly dividends and offers a balanced portfolio of elite heavyweights. The low-stress ETF is one of the best placess to invest $10,000 today.

(<a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/financial-summary/PATH\">NYSE:PATH</a>) is a leading company in the field of robotic process automation (RPA). It provides software that helps businesses automate repetitive tasks, improving efficiency and productivity. The company faces competition from other tech firms in the automation space, but it remains a significant player due to its innovative solutions and strong market presence.</p>\n\n<p>On July 3, 2025, Dines Daniel, the director, 10 percent owner, CEO, and Chairman of PATH, sold 45,000 shares of Class A Common Stock at approximately $13.01 each. Despite this sale, Daniel still holds a substantial 5,418,376 shares, indicating his continued confidence in the company's future. This transaction is officially documented on the SEC website.</p>\n\n<p>UiPath is navigating the challenges posed by generative AI, maintaining stability and easing fears of an existential crisis. The company is financially robust, with significant cash reserves and ongoing share repurchases. These factors, along with high customer retention rates, contribute to optimism for renewed growth and sustainable GAAP profitability.</p>\n\n<p>The company's financial metrics provide further insight into its current standing. UiPath's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is <strong>-108</strong>, reflecting negative earnings. However, the price-to-sales ratio of <strong>4.9</strong> and enterprise value to sales ratio of <strong>4.47</strong> suggest that investors see potential in the company's sales performance. The low debt-to-equity ratio of <strong>0.043</strong> indicates a conservative approach to debt.</p>\n\n<p>UiPath's current ratio of <strong>2.95</strong> highlights its strong ability to cover short-term liabilities with short-term assets. Despite a negative earnings yield of <strong>-0.93%</strong>, the company's enterprise value to operating cash flow ratio of <strong>19.1</strong> shows that investors are willing to pay for its operating cash flow. Management remains optimistic about the company's prospects for fiscal year 2027.</p>",

      "title": "I Found the Best Credit Card – 4.5X Rewards with Instant Redemption!",
      "content": "If you stopped 100 people on the street and asked them about the best credit card, you&#8217;d likely get 100 different answers. Whether it&#8217;s a travel card or a cash-back card, the debate over the best credit card is similar to the debate between Mac and PC, or Android and iPhone. The good news is that there are numerous credit cards available with benefits that cater to everyone. Key Points There are numerous great credit cards available, but a select few stand out above the rest. There is no question Reddit is in love with this particular card, but there is a giant caveat. The hope is that, regardless of which card you use, you pay it off every month. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) One Redditor posting in r/CreditCards claims to have found the secret credit card sauce. With 4.5x benefits on every purchase, they hope that they have found the one and only card they will ever need. As the card can also be used with Apple Pay, which is available everywhere they live, it’s good news all around. US Bank Altitude Reserve This isn&#8217;t the first time this particular subreddit has come out in favor of the US Bank Altitude Reserve card. There is no question this card is wildly popular with Redditors and US Bank customers in general. With 5x points on prepaid hotel and car rentals, 3x on eligible travel, and 1x on eligible purchases, there are definite benefits to using this card. In fact, the Redditor specifically calls out the 3x bonus points for mobile wallet payments, which is a definite bonus. As a Chicago resident, the Redditor notes that Apple Pay is available everywhere, allowing them to rack up 3x points every day. Of course, it wasn’t just Apple Pay that gave this card a little extra limelight. It was also the $325 annual statement credit for travel and dining purchases. The same applies to Priority Pass at airport lounges worldwide. The same goes for the $120 statement credit for either TSA PreCheck or Global Entry. Add in a concierge service, car rental discounts, and premium benefits at luxury hotel brands, and the benefits keep on coming. Unfortunately, there is one problem, as the US Bank Altitude Reserve card is no longer available to new customers. As of November 2024, the bank stopped taking new customers, while existing customers can continue to use their cards. Of course, the Reddit comment section is filled with individuals who want this card to return. They’ve seen posts like this one before in r/CreditCards, and they want in on the Reserve card fun. Best Alternative Still Available The difficult reality is that this card was so good that the prevailing thought was it was a loss leader, hence why it was shut down. The next big challenge is that there is near-universal agreement that no other card offers the same mix of benefits. This makes it pretty challenging to find a great alternative you can still sign up for right now. All of this said, the card that comes the closest, according to a large percentage of Redditors, is the Capital One Venture X card. Rest assured that these two cards are definitely not the same, but it&#8217;s about the closest comparison most people are comfortable with. Where the Venture X card does stand out is with the $300 annual travel card and $120 Global Entry or TSA PreCheck credit. Not to mention, you&#8217;ll receive 10,000 bonus miles, equivalent to $100 in travel, on your card&#8217;s first anniversary. As for purchases, you earn 10 times the points on all hotel and rental car purchases made through the Capital One Travel portal. Unfortunately, flights and vacation rentals only qualify for 5x points, while all other purchases only provide 2x points. On the bright side, you do get easy access to both Capital One lounges and 1,300 Priority Passes lounges worldwide. Make Sure to Maximize Your Rewards At the end of the day, what’s most important is to ensure you&#8217;re maximizing your rewards. Regardless of which card you have, consider setting up automatic payments to help keep your balance low. You should also regularly review your credit report to make sure there are no inaccuracies that could affect your credit limit down the line. Most importantly, ensure that you strategically use your travel points and cash-back cards to maximize value. In the same way you want to look for travel bonuses, the same goes for 5% rotating category cash-back credit cards, where you enjoy extra bonuses every quarter.

      "title": "Remplir sales surge: Orthocell CEO interview",
      "content": "Orthocell Ltd CEO and managing director Paul Anderson earlier this week spoke with Proactive after the company reported record revenue for the June 2025 quarter, citing strong uptake of its flagship Remplir nerve repair product. Highlights The company said quarterly revenue reached A$2.73 million, representing a 22.80 percent increase compared to the previous quarter. Orthocell highlighted that this growth reflected continued adoption across Australia, with more than 206 surgeons now using Remplir in over 166 hospitals. Anderson told investors that the commercial launch in Australia has been a “spectacular” success. The company noted that none of the reported revenue was generated in the United States, where it recently completed its first procedure. Orthocell said it has established a distribution network in the US, comprising 14 distributors and more than 100 representatives across 21 states. The company expects this infrastructure will drive further growth as the product is adopted by additional hospitals and surgeons. Anderson stated that preparations over the past two years have positioned the company to scale internationally. He said, “It leaves us in such a strong position,” adding that the lessons learned in Australia will inform the US commercial rollout. Potential catalysts for investors include increased US revenue contributions, further hospital engagements, and broader clinical use of Remplir. Orthocell also expects rising adoption rates in Australia to continue contributing to revenue momentum over the coming financial year. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL, ETR:APC) continues to show strength in its Services business, with global App Store revenue estimated to have increased by 12% year-over-year in June, according to Bank of America analysts. The firm maintains its ‘Buy’ rating on Apple and $235 price target, pointing to strong capital returns, leadership in on-device AI, and ongoing revenue diversification within the App Store. Bank of America estimates App Store revenues reached $8.4 billion in fiscal Q3 2025, up 11.5% year-over-year, based on developer-level data from SensorTower. Downloads across iPhone and iPad rose 4.3% year-over-year to 8.6 billion in the quarter, with dollars per download increasing to $0.98, a 6.9% improvement. “For the month of June, App Store revenue increased 12% year-over-year globally, outpacing app store download growth of 3% year-over-year,” analysts noted. Despite regulatory scrutiny and the Epic Games ruling, Bank of America analysts say there's no evidence of a material impact to App Store monetization. “We do not observe any indication of adverse impact on app store revenue,” they wrote, even as trends toward off-app payments become more common. The bank believes investor concerns around the ruling’s severity “appear to be moot.” The report also highlights a notable shift in App Store revenue mix, with gaming losing ground to other categories. While games still generate the largest share of revenue, their portion has dropped from over 50% to 45% in fiscal Q3. “Games remain as the leader of the global app store revenue by category list, though their share has declined,” the analysts wrote. Categories such as Photo & Video, Lifestyle, Books, Education, and Utilities each gained 100 basis points year-over-year, while Productivity jumped 200 basis points, the largest gain of any group. “This mix shift, albeit not as meaningful currently, may signal legacy game developers to diversify into non-games or expand existing in-app purchasing options,” Bank of America wrote. “We believe either scenario in the ensuing years could be a long-term tailwind for Apple’s App Store revenue.” Additionally, the top 10 developers globally now account for nearly a quarter of Apple’s year-to-date App Store revenue, according to the firm’s analysis. This group includes both single-app players like ChatGPT, FUNFLY, and Tinder, as well as diversified developers like Tencent, Google, and TikTok, which maintain broad app portfolios spanning entertainment, utilities, and productivity. Impact of US-Vietnam trade deal Meanwhile, proposed tariffs on goods exported from Vietnam into the US will have a minimal impact on Apple, analysts at UBS believe. While Vietnam has become an increasingly important part of the tech giant’s supply chain diversification strategy, the analysts highlighted that the region still accounts for only a small fraction, roughly 5%, of Apple’s global supply chain footprint. “Given the relatively small physical footprint and focus on ancillary products, a 20% tariff on imports into the US will have a negligible impact on Apple margins in our view,” they wrote. They see the financial impact as a “gross margin rounding error.” UBS estimates that approximately 35 Apple suppliers operate around 38 discrete facilities in Vietnam, concentrated in areas like Bac Giang, Bac Ninh, Hai Phong, Phu Tho, and Vinh Phuc. In comparison, mainland China still dominates the supply chain, representing over 35% of Apple’s supplier locations globally. UBS has a ‘Neutral’ rating and $210 price target on Apple, based on about 28 times their calendar year 2026 earnings per share (EPS) estimate, reflecting a higher equity risk premium and interest rates. “We note our financial projections reflect the impact of the proposed tariffs in the June quarter but not beyond given the fluid nature of the discussions,” they wrote. Shares of Apple finished Thursday’s trading session at about $213.",

      "title": "Jim Cramer Is Fixated On An International Rotation",
      "content": "One of the world’s most prolific talking heads around the stock market, Jim Cramer needs little introduction in the financial world. The host of MAD MONEY on CNBC, Cramer, has been in the investing and media game for years, and for the most part, he’s got his pulse on the market better than most. Key Points Jim Cramer is taking a long, hard look at some European names that have been overlooked. His take is that Europe has been overlooked for too long, and some major brands are experiencing financial growth in the region. Camer wholeheartedly believes that ignoring Europe would mean ignoring financial gains. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) A continent with nearly 750 million people, Cramer believes this region of the world has been overlooked for far too long. Indicating that this region is on the rise, his take is that the state of Europe is very strong, something heavyweight giants like the CEO of Cisco support wholeheartedly. Europe Is Coming Back There is no question that Cramer, who believes Wall Street has overlooked Europe unnecessarily, is fixated on the region&#8217;s sudden rise and the belief that a host of companies are experiencing significant success. Cramer notes that there has been an increase in spending, particularly in the technology sector, across Europe. He highlights that even the telecom companies, which have generally been adverse to big spending in the region, are now opening up their wallets in a meaningful and impactful way. His concern is that Wall Street has ignored Europe for far too long. Still, Portugal, Italy, Spain, and numerous other countries in the European region are now directly on Cramer’s radar. Amazon (AMZN) When it comes to Amazon, Cramer specifically highlights that the company has been losing money in Europe for as long as he can remember. Now, the company has turned the corner, showing at least one billion in profit in the last quarter alone, just from European sales. He also thinks that the stock is on the rise, specifically because investors are seeing the growth potential in Europe. According to online research, Amazon has a market penetration of at least 64% in Germany and approximately 50% of the online market in Spain. This is before you turn your attention to France, where 35% of the spending shoppers do online goes to Amazon. In Italy, nearly 70% of all online spending is directed to Amazon, which further supports Jim’s point that Amazon is a must-watch stock in Europe. Apple (AAPL) When you consider that Apple saw a 10% increase in iPhone shipments in Europe in the first quarter of 2025, despite a worldwide decline, it’s another reason in favor of Cramer’s outlook on the company. This led to almost a billion dollars in profit for the first quarter, similar to Amazon&#8217;s, just in Europe. Cramer indicates that nobody saw this coming, and yet, it’s a telling sign that Apple is seeing these kinds of numbers in the market. Burberry (BURBY) Burberry, headquartered in London, recently announced that it was laying off 20% of its global workforce, but this didn’t stop its stock from jumping in response. On June 25, 2025, the company highlighted that Q1 sales were proof that its resilience in the market was no fluke. It also expects the first quarter of its 2026 financial year to outperform the fourth quarter of 2025, which boosts Cramer&#8217;s argument about these specific companies. Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) European telecom giant Deutsche Telekom is also back on the rise, especially in light of its recent signing a deal with NVIDIA to establish an AI cloud for European manufacturers in Germany. NVIDIA said it will supply at least 10,000 chips to be used in Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s data centers, which is a win for both companies and demonstrates that DT is no longer hesitant to invest significantly. Cramer specifically highlights this willingness to open its wallet as a reason to keep an eye on this stock. ASML (ASML) Another company on Cramer’s radar is ASML, a Dutch multinational corporation specializing in the semiconductor industry, which is poised for significant financial growth. The company is standing by its reduced forecast from a month ago, but Cramer doesn’t think anyone is properly paying attention to the stock. He says this is one to watch.

      "title": "Jim Cramer: ‘Trump Discount’ Is Hurting Markets",
      "content": "Key Points in This Article: CNBC’s Mad Money host Jim Cramer is often criticized for inaccurate stock picks that inspire routine bets against his calls as a better way to beat the market. Due to his unreliable predictions and over-the-top policy complaints, investors would be better served by focusing on company fundamentals. Nvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of &#8216;Next Nvidia Stocks&#8217; that could be even better. Click here to learn more. A Controversial Track Record Jim Cramer is a polarizing figure in financial media, known for hosting CNBC’s Mad Money and co-anchoring Squawk on the Street. A Harvard-educated former hedge fund manager, Cramer’s high-energy stock picks and market commentary have made him a household name among retail investors. However, his predictions are frequently criticized for their inconsistency, with many noting he’s often wrong about his stock calls. This reputation led to the creation of the Inverse Cramer ETF, which aimed to profit by betting against his recommendations. Although the ETF shut down due to lack of interest, an X account named “Inverse Cramer” continues to mock his calls, highlighting his spotty track record. Cramer’s bold, sometimes erratic takes &#8212; such a a recent essay he wrote on a so-called “Trump discount” &#8212; often spark debate, with critics pointing to his tendency to overemphasize short-term noise over long-term fundamentals, making his advice a risky bet for investors. Cramer’s “Trump Discount” Thesis In his June 1 article, Jim Cramer argues that a “Trump discount” is suppressing U.S. stock market performance due to the unpredictability of President Trump’s policies. He contrasts Europe’s “consistency of mediocrity” with U.S. volatility, claiming the White House’s immense power creates instability. Cramer cites examples across sectors: Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) gains were short-lived due to policy uncertainty; retail stocks like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) face tariff-related confusion; drug companies suffer from shifting Medicare pricing policies and vaccine skepticism; food companies like Campbell’s (NYSE:CPB) face regulatory pressure from RFK Jr.; Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) struggles with Trump’s push for U.S.-only manufacturing; software and internet giants like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) face unexpected scrutiny; banks see no regulatory relief; mergers and acquisitions are stalled by unpredictable cash flows; and energy stocks, despite Trump’s pro-drilling stance, lack momentum due to high costs and regulatory hurdles. Cramer predicts continued market declines, noting a recent 1% S&amp;P 500 drop, exacerbated by mixed signals about U.S.-China trade talks. Flaws in Cramer’s Argument Cramer’s thesis appears flawed for several reasons. First, his “Trump discount” overstates the impact of presidential policies on broad market performance. The S&amp;P 500, far from being discounted, has gained since he wrote his article, and is near record highs, contradicting his bearish outlook. Second, his sector-specific arguments lack depth. Nvidia’s volatility is more tied to market cycles and competition than Trump’s policies. Retailers like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and TJX (NYSE:TJX) have thrived despite tariff fears, with Costco’s stock rising due to strong fundamentals, not a “Trump premium.” Third, Cramer’s focus on short-term policy noise ignores long-term drivers like corporate earnings and consumer demand. His concerns about drug stocks, which he ties to RFK Jr.’s influence, overstate the impact of unconfirmed regulatory changes, since Medicare negotiation frameworks remain complex and slow-moving. Similarly, his critique of Apple misinterprets global supply chain dynamics; India’s manufacturing shift is a strategic diversification, not a policy misstep. Cramer’s Track Record and Market Misreads Cramer’s historical inaccuracy fuels skepticism. The Inverse Cramer ETF, though defunct, capitalized on his poor track record, and the ongoing X account highlights his frequent misses. His alarmist tone, comparing Trump’s influence to Andrew Jackson’s era, exaggerates political impact while downplaying market resilience. For instance, energy stocks’ stagnation is less about Trump’s policies and more about global oil prices and ESG pressures, which Cramer barely addresses. His claim that Europe’s markets outperform due to “consistency” ignores their own challenges, like Germany’s 2025 economic slowdown. By fixating on sensationalized policy risks, Cramer overlooks broader market trends, such as technology-driven gains and robust consumer spending, which have propelled the S&amp;P 500 upward. Key Takeaways As always, focus on fundamentals, not noise. Investors should tune out sky-is-falling narratives like Cramer’s, which amplify short-term concerns over fundamentals. However, blind optimism about endless market gains is equally misguided. Markets naturally rise and fall, influenced by policies but driven by earnings, innovation, and economic cycles. While presidential actions, like tariffs or deregulation, can create volatility, they don’t dictate long-term outcomes. Investors would do well to focus on business fundamentals &#8212; revenue growth, profit margins, and competitive advantages &#8212; rather than reacting to pundits like Cramer. Consistent, long-term investing, diversified across sectors, remains the most reliable path to wealth creation, regardless of political headlines.

UBS Touts Preferred Securities 11:22 am by Gerelyn Terzo UBS senior fixed income strategist Frank Sileo is bullish on preferred securities, which blend features of both stocks and bonds. Sileo wrote: “For long-term investors, preferreds can provide high-quality, diverse, and durable portfolio income.&#8221; According to S&amp;P Global, the majority of preferred securities are issued by banks. The Nasdaq Composite is holding onto gains, up 0.46%. Bearish on Banks 10:07 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street firm Baird is bearish on a couple of banks. The analyst firm warned that recent gains in financial stocks JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) might soon be erased, owing to a questionable risk-reward future for both stocks. Baird handed both stocks downgrades, including JPM to an &#8220;underperform&#8221; and BAC to &#8220;neutral&#8221; with price targets of $235 and $52, respectively, attached. The Nasdaq Composite is now up 0.34%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The broader markets have crossed over into record territory on Friday even in the face of economic uncertainty. The S&amp;P 500 has pushed beyond the 6,147 level to 6,159 in early trading, a fresh all-time high. In fact, all three of the major stock market averages are advancing, including a 0.34% gain in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and a fractional gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Big Tech stocks are trading mixed, with notable gains in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) of 1% and 1.8%, respectively. President Trump has announced an agreement between the U.S. and China on trade. According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the U.S. tariffs on China are 30% compared with Beijing&#8217;s 10% on the U.S. On the economic data front, the May personal consumption expenditures price index rose by 0.1% last month, resulting in an annual inflation rate of 2.3%. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy costs, increased to 2.7%, higher than the Federal Reserve had anticipated. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 314.99 (+0.73%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 108.50 (+0.56%) S&amp;P 500: Up 33.86 (+0.56%) Market Movers Nike (NYSE: NKE) is tacking on 15.4% today after its quarterly results beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines.

Apple Stock Bump 11:10 am by Gerelyn Terzo Bank of America analysts have reaffirmed their &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock, pointing to the App Store results as a positive catalyst. Earlier this week, Jefferies analysts lifted their outlook on Apple shares to &#8220;hold&#8221; from &#8220;underperform.&#8221; Apple stock is up 0.78% today but is down 14% year-to-date. Fed in Focus 9:58 am by Gerelyn Terzo With today&#8217;s strong jobs data, indicating a healthy economy, Wall Street analysts are predicting what to expect when Fed policymakers convene next. Here&#8217;s a roundup of some of the commentary: BMO&#8217;s Ian Lyngen remarked, “Overall, it was a strong set of data that implies the Fed will remain on hold later this month, leaving rate cut expectations focused on the September FOMC meeting.” Mutual of America Capital Management CEO Joe Gaffoglio wrote, “The June jobs report continues to demonstrate resilience across the labor market, even as certain sectors such as manufacturing continue to lag. The unemployment rate is holding steady at 4.1%, and real average hourly earnings for employees experienced its largest increase of the year.” Goldman Sachs&#8217; Head of Fixed Income Macro Strategies Simon Dangoor commented: “Today’s stronger jobs report confirms a still resilient U.S. labor market, defying, at least for now, the signs of weakness seen in some leading indicators. The FOMC’s conviction that it should hold its wait-and-see stance while it braces for an acceleration in inflation over the summer will only be strengthened. But we still see a path to a resumption of the Fed’s easing cycle later in the year should the summer acceleration in inflation prove more modest than expected.” This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are celebrating a stronger-than-expected jobs report for June, sending all three of the major stock market indices higher. The economy added 147,000 payrolls last month, far outpacing economist forecasts calling for a slowdown in hiring. Meanwhile, past data was revised upward, while the unemployment rate dropped from 4.2% to 4.1%, once again outshining most expectations. The Nasdaq Composite is on pace for yet another record high, as is the broader S&amp;P 500 market index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.28%. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green today, led by telecom, consumer discretionary and technology. Big Tech is driving much of the gains in the Nasdaq Composite today, including a 2% rise in Meta Technologies (Nasdaq: META) amid an analyst upgrade at Needham, which has assigned a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the stock, up from &#8220;underperform.&#8221; Elon Musk weighed in on X, asking in delight, &#8220;They had a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating on Zuck?&#8221; Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 149.16 (+0.34%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 125.10 (+0.61%) S&amp;P 500: Up 29.48 (+0.48%) Market Movers Datadog (Nasdaq: DDOG), which is behind a cloud-based security platform, is advancing 9.1% today after being chosen as the latest addition to the S&amp;P 500, replacing the outgoing Juniper Networks, which is being acquired by Hewlett Packard (NYSE: HPE). With the index inclusion, DDOG will gain exposure to more institutional and retail portfolios including through ETFs. Synopsys (Nasdaq: SNPS) is gaining 4.4% after the U.S. withdrew U.S. &#8220;chip design software curbs on China,&#8221; per reports. Tripadvisor (Nasdaq: TRIP) is soaring 11.5% today on the heels of an investment by activist investor Starboard, which after taking a 9% position in the stock called the shares undervalued.

      "title": "Warren Buffett’s Best Investment Quote",
      "content": "A recent list of Warren Buffett’s best quotes includes his primary view of investing. It represents sound advice that is as good as that provided by any seasoned investor: &#8220;The first rule of an investment is don&#8217;t lose (money). And the second rule of an investment is don&#8217;t forget the first rule. And that&#8217;s all the rules there are.&#8221; 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: One of Warren Buffett’s best pieces of investment advice is not to lose money. He may have lost money on some investments, but not enough to offset his overall spectacular returns. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) A $100 investment in his flagship company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B), which he took over in 1965, was worth $5.5 million at the end of last year. Some of this growth is due to financial companies that he favors and has acquired. This includes insurance company GEICO and several reinsurance companies. However, the largest private corporation he owns is the massive railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe Company. Two investments demonstrate the diversification of Buffett’s holdings. One is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) (some of which he sold off recently), and the other is the Chinese EV company BYD. He purchased many of his BYD shares in 2008 when the company was still an obscure carmaker. That investment of $230 million is worth $2.4 billion. BYD sells more EVs than Tesla does. Some of his investments are in America’s oldest companies. These are also some of America’s valuable and visible brands. Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) was launched in 1886. Berkshire Hathaway was a significant company before Buffett took over in 1965. Kroger Inc. (NYSE: KR) was founded in 1883. American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) got its start in 1850. All were part of Buffett’s holdings in the first quarter of 2025. He has held some of these for most of this century. These represent part of his investment rules and philosophies. Often among the best investments are companies that have been industry giants and successful since before Buffett was born in 1930. He and his staff can examine earnings, business models, and both good and bad decisions. He can look at CEOs, both present and past, and he can sift through balance sheets. Buffett has observed the strategies of their competitors and has seen how these companies navigate business cycles, both good and bad. To be clear, Buffett likes to invest in companies that are relatively new and have been the winners in the new world of tech. This includes, among others, Amazon and Apple. As he watched Apple stock tumble, he sold off some of those holdings. Buffett has lost money on some investments, but not enough to dent his overall spectacular returns.

(<a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/financial-summary/AAPL\">NASDAQ:AAPL</a>) sees an <strong>8% year-over-year increase</strong> in iPhone sales in China for Q2 2025.</li>\n<li>The growth is attributed to promotional pricing of the iPhone 16 lineup during the 618 shopping festival.</li>\n<li>Despite positive sales growth, Apple's performance was outpaced by Huawei, highlighting the competitive nature of the Chinese market.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>On July 3, 2025, UBS reiterated its Neutral rating for <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/financial-summary/AAPL\">Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)</a>, advising investors to hold the stock. At the time, Apple's share price was <strong>$214.33</strong>. This rating comes amidst a notable development in Apple's performance in China, a key market for the company.</p>\n\n<p>Apple has achieved an <strong>8% year-over-year increase</strong> in iPhone sales in China during the second quarter of 2025. This marks the first quarterly growth in the region since 2023. The growth is largely due to promotional pricing strategies for the iPhone 16 lineup, particularly the Pro and Pro Max models. These strategies were well-timed with the 618 shopping festival, a major discount event in China.</p>\n\n<p>Despite this positive development, Apple's growth in China was outpaced by Huawei, a major competitor, which reported a <strong>12% increase</strong> in sales. This highlights the competitive nature of the Chinese smartphone market. Apple's strategic price adjustments, including increased trade-in values, played a crucial role in boosting sales during this period.</p>\n\n<p>The resurgence in iPhone sales is a significant milestone for Apple as it seeks to solidify its presence in China, one of its most vital markets. The company's market capitalization stands at approximately <strong>$3.2 trillion</strong>, reflecting its substantial influence in the tech industry. As of the latest trading day, Apple's stock price increased by approximately <strong>0.90%</strong> to <strong>$214.36</strong>, with a trading volume of <strong>23.8 million</strong> shares.</p>\n\n<p>Apple's stock has fluctuated between a low of <strong>$211.81</strong> and a high of <strong>$214.64</strong> during the trading day. Over the past year, the stock has reached a high of <strong>$260.10</strong> and a low of <strong>$169.21</strong>. These figures indicate the volatility and potential for growth in Apple's stock, making UBS's Neutral rating a cautious yet reasonable stance for investors.</p>",
