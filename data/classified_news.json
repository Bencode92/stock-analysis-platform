      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Buy the Rumor 1:41 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Bank of America has issued a report advising investors to buy the trade deal anticipation but sell the news. BofA Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett wrote, &#8220;Oversold equities have correctly front-run Q2 trade deals/lower tariffs. We expect âbuy the expectation, sell the fact,â stocks fade into the trade deals.&#8221; The White House is expected to meet with China officials on potentially reaching a trade agreement over the weekend. Stocks remain lower out of caution. Markets Hold Back 12:09 pm by Gerelyn Terzo China&#8217;s government officials have come out swinging against the White House, saying they strongly opposes what they described as &#8220;U.S. abuse&#8221; of reciprocal tariffs. Earlier today, President Trump revealed that he was willing to reduce tariffs on China imports to 80% from a triple-digit percentage level. Washington, D.C. and Beijing officials are set to come to the negotiating table this weekend. Stocks are lower on the trade deal uncertainty. Markets Reverse Course 10:52 am by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market has reversed course, leaving all three of the major stock market averages in the red after coming out of the gate higher on China trade deal hopes. Traders and investors appear to be playing it cautiously until the White House and Beijing sign on the dotted line. Market declines are modest, including a 0.07% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. At this rate, stocks are likely to continue meandering between positive and negative ground for now. Weekly Performance 9:44 am by Gerelyn Terzo The Nasdaq Composite is on pace for a fractional gain today and has advanced a more impressive 7.9% over the past month. Year-to-date, the tech-heavy index is still lower by 6%. Over the past five trading sessions, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) has gained 5% while Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) has lost 7.4%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are looking to end the week on a positive note after getting some good news on the trade war. President Trump revealed that he is willing to slash tariffs on China imports from a triple-digit percentage to 80%, saying that level seems appropriate as the White House gears up for talks with Beijing. Stocks appear to be cautiously optimistic on the development, with all three of the major stock market averages headed higher this morning. While China has been the wildcard, the Trump administration suggested that multiple agreements are being reached with U.S. trade partners, injecting further optimism into these markets. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green, led by the energy, consumer discretionary and technology sectors. Magnificent Seven stocks are lifting the Nasdaq Composite higher, including a 1% gain in Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) and 2.5% jump in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also getting a pop from Boeing (NYSE: BA) stock on a strong Dreamliners jet order from the British Airways parent company. BA stock is up 1.4%. Hereâs a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 114.55 (+0.26%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 102.00 (+0.57%) S&amp;P 500: Up 24.36 (+0.41%) Market Movers Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) might be a volatile play, but that is what it takes to trade as one of the leading tech stocks. As of yesterday, Palantir has muscled its way into the top 10 most valuable technology plays in the U.S. market, boasting a market capitalization of $281.1 billion. By way of comparison, Salesforce&#8217;s (NYSE: CRM) market cap currently hovers at a lesser $268.4 billion. PLTR stock is down 1% today on profit taking. Ad-tech platform The Trade Desk (Nasdaq: TTD) is soaring 22.8% today after reporting strong Q1 results. Revenue ballooned by 25% to $616 million. Earlier this month, RBC maintained a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $85 per share, reflecting upside potential of 41%. Lyft (Nasdaq: LYFT) stock is rising today after lifting its Q2 forecast and initiating a $750 million share buyback program. Most Wall Street analysts have a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the stock. Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) is taking a breather after announcing a blockbuster deal to acquire options trading platform Deribit in a $2.9 billion deal, thrusting it into the crypto derivatives realm.

      "title": "5 Dividend ETFs to Buy and Hold for a Lifetime of Passive Income",
      "content": "Dividend stock investing offers a reliable path to passive income and long-term wealth creation, making it a cornerstone for many portfolios. By owning shares in companies that pay regular dividends, investors gain consistent cash flow, often from stable, high-quality firms like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Dividends provide a hedge against market volatility, as payouts persist even during downturns, and reinvesting them can compound returns significantly over time. Moreover, dividend-paying stocks historically outperform non-dividend peers, with lower volatility. 24/7 Wall St. Insights: Dividend stock investing has proven a reliable path for investors to gather immense wealth over time. Dividend ETFs bolster those results by investing in hundreds of dividend-paying stocks, offering instant diversification and minimizing single-stock risk. Sit back and let dividends do the heavy lifting for a simple, steady path to serious wealth creation over time. Grab a free copy of â2 Legendary High-Yield Dividend Stocksâ now. Dividend-paying exchange-traded funds (ETFs) enhance these benefits by pooling dozens or hundreds of such stocks, offering instant diversification, reduced single-stock risk, and low expense ratios. In 2025âs uncertain market, marked by tariffs and persistent inflation, dividend ETFs provide resilience and income stability. Pursuing this strategy ensures steady returns and growth, making it ideal for both novice and seasoned investors seeking financial security. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Any discussion of dividend ETFs must begin with Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). It is a top-tier dividend ETF, tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index with around 100 high-quality stocks like Lockheed-Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), each boasting more than 10 years of dividend growth. The ETF&#8217;s 3.7% yield and ultra-low 0.06% expense ratio make it cost-effective while limiting sector exposure to no more than 25% ensures diversification. SCHDâs 11.4% annualized return over a decade reflects its balance of income and growth. Because SCHD focuses on financially sound companies, the dividend ETF mitigates risks, offering investors stability. For those seeking high yield and reliability, SCHD stock is a must-own ETF for lifelong passive income. Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM) The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSE:VYM) tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, holding 589 stocks like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), with no stock exceeding 4% of the portfolio.

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Interest Rate Cuts in Flux 9:56 am by Gerelyn Terzo Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee stated Friday that President Donald Trump&#8217;s recent tariff actions have thrown a wrench into monetary policy likely delaying any adjustments to interest rates. He told CNBC: &#8220;Everythingâs always on the table. But I feel like the bar for me is a little higher for action in any direction while weâre waiting to get some clarity.&#8221; This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are in freefall on Friday, with all three of the major stock market averages lower by at least 1%. The markets are poised to end the week on a negative note after President Trump threatened to impose a steep 50% tariff on the EU, which could take effect in the coming days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is reeling by over 400 points, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are similarly down 1% today. Most sectors of the economy are trading lower, with the worst declines seen in consumer discretionary and technology stocks. Treasury yields are falling as the trade war reignites, capping off a roller coaster week for the bond market. Volatility has also returned to the stock market, as evidenced by a 25% increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). Additionally, Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) has a target on its back after President Trump also cautioned that iPhones made outside of the U.S. could be subject to heavy tariffs. Apple stock is down 2% today. In a bright spot for the Magnificent Seven stocks, influential Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is bullish on Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), lifting his price target on the EV maker to $500, reflecting 49% upside potential, with an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating attached. Hereâs a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 400.50 (-0.96%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 309.43 (-1.6%) S&amp;P 500: Down 66.80 (-1.1%) Market Movers Nuclear stocks are bucking the downward trend today and gaining ground as the Trump administration looks to implement favorable conditions for the industry. Stocks including Oklo (NYSE: OKLO), NuScale (NYSE: SMR) and Constellation Energy (Nasdaq: CEG) are all advancing today, led by a double-digit percentage gain for OKLO. Quantum computing stock IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) fell as much as 4.7% today, following yesterday&#8217;s rally that saw the share price close above $45.

Policymakers kept the range of short-term borrowing rates between 4.25% and 4.5%, as widely expected. In commentary, the Fed pointed to heightened economic uncertainty, including rising risks around inflation and unemployment. Policymakers also introduced the idea of stagflation, causing the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to withhold any gains.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon believes the risks around the threat of both inflation and deflation have yet to surface in stock market values.

According to Dalio, the credit agency&#8217;s analysis fails to account for the inherent risk of the federal government resorting to money printing to service its massive debt. While Treasury yields rise, the markets remain under pressure, including a 0.17% decline in the SPX ETF. Retail Stocks in Focus 10:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo This week, the market&#8217;s focus pivots to corporate earnings, with reports due from major players like Home Depot (NYSE: HD), Target (NYSE: TGT) and TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX). Notably, TJX stock has already climbed 11% this year so far. Comparable store sales figures will be under close examination amid ongoing high interest rates as well as signs of cooling inflation. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are narrowing their declines in the face of a U.S. debt downgrade by one of the credit rating agencies. Moody&#8217;s lowered its view of U.S. debt by a single notch to to Aa1, down from the highest possible rating. Moody&#8217;s blamed the persistent budget deficit and high interest rates, a view challenged by President Trump, who affirmed global confidence in the U.S. economy. The credit downgrade adds insult to injury following a week in which the S&amp;P 500 advanced 5%. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC he predicts one interest rate cut in 2025 as the economy continues to stave off a recession. The central bank has tipped its hand to a possible two rate cuts this year. Today&#8217;s credit downgrade sent Treasury yields higher, with the 30-year Treasury surpassing the 5% threshold, and weighed heavily on equities. While the SPX ETF is currently down slightly, the three major averages are showing signs of resilience, paring back their earlier losses as the morning progresses. The broader technology sector is currently down 1.4%. The prominent Magnificent Seven stocks are mostly in the red, including a 2.8% decline in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny of its proposed AI partnership with China&#8217;s Alibaba. Hereâs a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 44.18 (-0.10%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 103.54 (-0.54%) S&amp;P 500: Down 20.36 (-0.34%) Market Movers Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is down 2.3% after announcing potential price increases due to tariffs, a move countered by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent&#8217;s suggestion that the retailer will &#8220;absorb some of the tariffs.&#8221; Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) has seen a 3.8% decline but remains close to its recent high of $130.18. Novavax (Nasdaq: NVAX) is a significant gainer, soaring 25.9% following regulatory approval for its COVID-19 vaccine. Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) shares are lower by 4.4% on the back of an analyst downgrade. Take-Two Interactive Software (Nasdaq: TTWO) is bucking the trend, climbing 3.7% after a price target increase from Wedbush Securities.

      "content": "Jensen Huang, who arguably runs the world&#8217;s most successful company, made only $1.5 million last year, according to the Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) proxy (PRE 14A). That is up $1 million from the year before. That pay was so low because most of his compensation comes from stock awards and ânonincentive compensation,â which can vary. In other words, the $1.5 million was all he could count on. It was his first base salary increase in a decade. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Last year, Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) Jensen Huang had his first base salary increase in a decade. Low compensation is not usually for CEOs who run the worldâs most valuable companies. Take this quiz to see if youâre on track to retire. (sponsored) Huang has a net worth of $98 billion, which makes him the 17th richest person in the world. Nvidiaâs stock is down this year, so that figure has dropped $16 billion since January 1. Nvidia is the third most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of $2.7 trillion. The stock has dropped 17% so far this year. Most of Huangâs compensation for the recently reported year came from a stock award of $38 million. The problem with that award is that, if Nvidiaâs stock drops, that sum could go down as well. Huang owns 3.5% of the company he founded in 1993. He turned it from a graphic chip company into the largest artificial intelligence (AI) company in the world. Huangâs low compensation is not usually for CEOs who run the worldâs most valuable companies. Warren Buffettâs cash compensation last year was only $100,000. Because of his ownership in Berkshire Hathaway, his net worth is $166 billion, which makes him the sixth richest person in the world. From 1997 to 2011 when Steve Jobs retired as Appleâs CEO, his base cash compensation was only $1. Tim Cook, Appleâs CEO today, had a base cash salary of $3 million last year. The low base salaries of highly successful CEOs are hard to explain. Do they tell investors that their pay is tied almost completely to performance? Or are they saying that to their employees? Huang and his board did not say. Three Things That Need to Happen for Nvidia to Have Another Banner Year in 2025 The post Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Made Only $1.5 Million Last Year appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

The company operates a fleet of tankers, making it a key participant in the global oil supply chain. Frontline competes with other major shipping companies, navigating challenges such as fluctuating oil prices and geopolitical tensions.</p>\n\n<p>On May 23, 2025, Frontline reported <strong>earnings per share (EPS) of $0.15</strong>, falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.18. This marks a continuation of a trend, as Frontline has missed the consensus estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average miss of 10%. Despite this, the company generated <strong>revenue of approximately $428 million</strong>, surpassing the estimated $320 million.</p>\n\n<p>The company's financial performance in Q1 2025 was likely influenced by several factors. Low spot tanker rates and increased voyage operating costs may have impacted profitability. Additionally, supply-chain disruptions and geopolitical risks posed operational challenges, potentially affecting Frontline's bottom line.</p>\n\n<p>Frontline's market valuation is reflected in its financial ratios. The company has a <strong>price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.14</strong>, indicating how the market values its earnings. Its <strong>price-to-sales ratio is 1.97</strong>, showing the value investors place on its revenue. The <strong>enterprise value to sales ratio stands at 3.59</strong>, assessing the company's total value in relation to its sales.</p>\n\n<p>The company's financial health is further highlighted by its <strong>debt-to-equity ratio of 1.60</strong>, indicating its leverage. A <strong>current ratio of 1.39</strong> suggests Frontline's ability to cover short-term liabilities with short-term assets. With an <strong>earnings yield of 12.29%</strong>, the company offers a return on investment for shareholders, reflecting its cash-generating ability.</p>",
