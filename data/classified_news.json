      "title": "Live Nasdaq Composite: AMZN (Nasdaq: AMZN), CEG (Nasdaq: CEG) Fall in Sea of Red",
      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Markets Lose Their Mojo 4:00 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets finished the day much like they started it &#8211; lower. All three of the major stock market indexes were sent reeling today, including an eye-popping 4% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. Right behind it was the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with nearly another 1,000-point drop, and the S&amp;P 500, falling 3.3%. President Trump is willing to extend the 90-day tariff relief, but it did little to lift the market sentiment today. Meanwhile, the trade war with China is only becoming more intense, with Fox Business reporting that President Trump is looking to delist China-listed companies from the U.S. stock market. Here&#8217;s a look at today&#8217;s damage: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 964.73 (-2.38%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 698.15 (-4.08%) S&amp;P 500: Down 181.50 (-3.3%) Tariff Fears Return 1:36 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The Nasdaq Composite&#8217;s 5.8% drop is being fueled by declines in Big Tech, including Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), which are each down between 4% and 7% today. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 is barreling toward circuit breaker status in which trading on the NYSE is halted to prevent further panic selling. President Trump is speaking with Cabinet members today on Capitol Hill while a U.S./China trade war fuels selling. Every sector of the economy is showing red today, including a 6.7% drop in energy stocks. Apple Falls 6% 11:52 am by Gerelyn Terzo Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock is falling by over 6% in today&#8217;s trading action. The declines come on the heels of the day in which it experienced its best trading day in nearly three decades. The broader market selling has intensified, sending the Nasdaq Composite spiraling by about 5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower by 3.4% and the S&amp;P 500 lower by 4.2%, erasing much of yesterday&#8217;s gains. Tariffs are easing while inflation is falling, but stocks are still spooked. Roller Coaster Ride 10:06 am by Gerelyn Terzo Stocks remain under pressure as of mid-morning trading, including a 3.2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite after yesterday&#8217;s historic performance. The easing tariffs have failed to lift market sentiment today. Used-car platform CarMax (NYSE: KMX) is falling 14% after a disappointing fiscal Q4 earnings print. Taiwan Semi (TSMC) is falling by 3%. Trump Media (Nasdaq: DJT) is falling 1%. U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) is falling by 7.3%. The markets opened in a sea of red on the heels of yesterday&#8217;s historic rally. Today these skittish markets are taking back some of those gains after investors followed President Trump&#8217;s advice to buy the dip. Despite tariff relief, all three of the major stock market averages went south, with Big Tech names dragging the Nasdaq Composite lower. Most sectors of the economy were under pressure in early trading, including declines of over 3% each in energy and tech. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) is down 3% this morning. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on CNBC that the current market environment could be a tailwind for acquisitions. He also believes sellers on the e-commerce platform would pass along tariff costs to consumers. The company continues to invest heavily in AI. The markets has the opportunity to shift their attention from tariffs to inflation this morning. In a dose of good news, the Labor Department&#8217;s latest inflation print came in cooler than expected, with consumer prices easing to 2.4% in the 12-month stretch leading up to March, compared with economists expectations of 2.6%. On a monthly basis, the CPI declined by 0.1% last month after climbing higher by 0.2% in February, a welcome shift. Historically, March inflation generally increases, with this year marking a notable shift in the trend. Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 706.27 (-1.74%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 478.08 (-2.7%) S&amp;P 500: Down 117.81 (-2.16%) Market Movers Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stock is off 5% today. The company has begun selling its EVs in Saudi Arabia where it is hoping to drive a social shift in the oil-rich Kingdom that is dependent on fossil-fueled powered vehicles. Cognizant Technology Solutions (Nasdaq: CTSH) is falling by 3% today after inking a partnership deal with OMRON&#8217;s automation business products. With a market cap of $34.8 billion, CTSH pays a dividend yield of 1.8%. Energy stocks are also under pressure, including Constellation Energy (Nasdaq: CEG), which is falling by 3.5% today. The stock is up over 10% in the past five days and is experiencing profit taking today though it remains above the $200 threshold.

UnitedHealth Group stock has been a weight on the Dow and S&amp;P 500 today after its worrying quarterly results and outlook. Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON), which is part of the Nasdaq Composite, is gaining over 2% on the day. The company reports its quarterly results on April 29. The company is in the midst of spinning off a couple of business divisions, and the stock is nearing the $200 per share level. Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) is down 1% after BMO Capital cut its price target on the stock to $200 per share, which still represents upside from current levels of $151 per share. Texas Instruments (Nasdaq: TXN) is gaining 1.5% on the day as the company expands its chip footprint in the auto sector. Market Gains Slip 8:17 am The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are struggling to keep their grip on gains after coming out of the gate higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains pressured with a 1.2% loss on the day. UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) stock is a major drag on the Dow, owing to disappointing quarterly results, while CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) remains a bright spot, rising 1.2% on the day. Chip stock Qualcomm (Nasdaq: QCOM) is up nearly 1% this morning on a bullish report out of Citi analysts. Sector performance is largely positive, led by a 2.4% gain in energy stocks but dampened by a tech sector that has just turned south. After yesterday&#8217;s massive technology sell-off, the markets are licking their wounds, with the three major stock market averages giving a mixed showing. Among the gainers is the Nasdaq Composite with a 0.63% advance and the S&amp;P 500 also fractionally higher while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently erasing over 400 points. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green today, a complete reversal from yesterday&#8217;s leader board. The markets are still processing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell&#8217;s comments from yesterday, which were on the hawkish side of monetary policy. Earnings are capturing some attention away from tariffs with railway CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) gaining 1% on the heels of its Q1 print. CSX faced challenges in the quarter, including a 7% year-over-year decline in revenue, but met consensus expectations amid a backdrop of weaker coal prices and dwindling fuel surcharges. Big Tech is mostly showing green this morning but remains mired in losses over the past five-day stretch, including a 2% drop in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), 14% decline in Meta (Nasdaq: META) and nearly 9% drop in Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) over the past week or so. UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) is a big drag on the Dow, shaving off 18% of its value today alone on disappointing earnings results. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 446 (-1.09%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 118.75 (+0.65%) S&amp;P 500: Up 22 (+0.41%) Market Movers Qualcomm (Nasdaq; QCOM) is rising today on the heels of a bullish report out of Citi analysts, who reportedly raised estimates on the company and added it to their positive catalyst watchlist thanks to robust demand for its chipsets out of China. QCOM stock has been volatile and is down 11% year-to-date. Citi also likes Generac Holdings (Nasdaq: GNRC), upgrading the stock to &#8220;buy&#8221; with a &#8220;high-risk&#8221; tone from &#8220;neutral.&#8221; BMO has upgraded shares of wood producer (NYSE: TREX) Trex to &#8220;outperform&#8221; from &#8220;market perform,&#8221; calling shares attractive. The stock is up 1.8% today. The post Live Nasdaq Composite: CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) Rises Amid Pivot to Earnings appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

      "title": "Live Nasdaq Composite: Gold Up, APLD (Nasdaq: APLD) Rises 5% in Bright Spot",
      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Nasdaq Composite Spirals 4% Lower 3:11 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets have widened their losses after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell addressed tariffs and their impact on the economy. Chairman Powell warned that tariffs could throw a wrench into the central bank&#8217;s efforts to tame inflation and spur economic growth. The Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach to monetary policy in the meantime. The Nasdaq Composite is spiraling 4% lower, weighed down by a 9% drop in Nvidia (Nasdaq; NVDA) and other Big Tech names on the tariff fallout. All sectors of the economy are lower with the exception of energy, which is up 1% as a group. Here&#8217;s a look at where things stand as of late afternoon trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 847.60 (-2.10%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 713.07 (-4.24%) S&amp;P 500: Down 161.77 (-3%) Gainers in a Sea of Red 12:32 pm by Gerelyn Terzo While the markets are a sea of red, including a 2.1% drop in the Nasdaq Composite, there are some gainers if you dig deep enough. We found a few, including: eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) is up 2.5% on the day and is inching closer to its 52-week high of approximately $71 per share. The online auction platform could be gaining from a newly announced partnership with Checkout.com for payments. Bitcoin stock MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) is tacking on 1.2% today while the bitcoin price continues to hover below the $85,000 level. On its best day, bitcoin serves as an inflationary hedge from the economy, which stands to benefit MSTR stock. Expand Energy (Nasdaq: EXE) is gaining 1.7% as a rising energy sector lifts those boats. Tariff Fallout 10:04 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure as of mid-morning trading, with the three major stock market averages stuck in a rut. While March retails sales rose a higher than expected 1.4%, the markets are obsessed with Nvidia (Nasdaq; NVDA), which warned that it will take a massive $5.5 billion charge for processor exports to China, giving the markets their &#8216;I told you so&#8217; moment. Magnificent Seven stocks are each down in the ballpark of 2% this morning, including Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), whose market cap has dipped below the $3 trillion threshold. The markets are under pressure out of the gate despite stronger than anticipated economic data. All three of the major stock market averages are trading in the red, including a 1.7% drop in the Nasdaq Composite, which is being weighed down by Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA). On the flip side, Applied Digital (Nasdaq: APLD) is gaining 5% today, bucking the otherwise downward trend, on the heels of its fiscal Q3 results. Despite missing Wall Street&#8217;s expectations, Applied Digital is benefiting from its roll in data center infrastructure for AI and high-performance computing, two white-hot tech trends. The gold price is rising 2.4% today to $3,319.30 per ounce as investors flock to the inflationary hedge during these times of heightened uncertainty. Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) is gaining 4% on the day as a beneficiary of the gold rush. The technology sector is being dragged lower by NVDA stock after the company revealed an upcoming $5.5 billion charge related to chip exports to China, igniting trade war selling once again. Nvidia shares are sinking 5.6% today. Most sectors of the economy are down, including a 2.4% decline for technology, while energy stocks are up by 1%. Each of the Magnificent 7 stocks is lower today. Retail sales grew by 1.4% in March, stronger than the expected 1.2% increase and providing yet another sign of a resilient U.S. consumer. Results excluding auto sales also beat economist projections, coming in at 0.5% vs. estimates of 0.3% even in the face of tariff uncertainty targeting the auto sector. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 165.73 (-0.41%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 292.95 (-1.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 47.89 (-0.90%) Market Movers BofA analysts have reiterated their &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Nvidia stock, but it&#8217;s doing little to lift sentiment in shares today. The Wall Street firm also lowered their price target on NVDA to $160 from $200 per share, blaming tariff uncertainty. Oppenheimer analysts have begun coverage on new stock Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) with an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating attached. Piper Sandler likes Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stock, reiterating its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on the EV maker while lowering the price target from $450 to $400 per share.

As a result, investors from all levels of experience are looking at their portfolios and considering reassessment of their holdings, at least to better handle the current volatility and to reduce the sleepless nights of worry. Key Points The current turbulence in the stock markets are giving both novice and seasoned investors some cause for reconsidering their portfolio compositions. ETFs like SCHD have aspects like dividend focus, which may make them less volatile than ones like VOO, which exclusively tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index. People who are new to investing can find the gigantic menu of choices overwhelming and intimidating, so knowing one’s own goals and risk tolerance before selecting an investment vehicle is a prudent rule of thumb to follow.

Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Navigating Through A Huge Menu Of Selections The huge array of available investment selections can be intimidating and overwhelming neophyte investors. A relatively new investor with $3,000 to invest was seeking vehicle suggestions, and posted a question on Reddit. He was considering the following, but was open to any other suggestions: He was considering investing in the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE: SCHD) based on what he’d read from other posts. The poster was looking to contribute $100 per week to take advantage of compounding and dollar cost averaging. Admittedly young and inexperienced, he did understand how investing for the long-term was to his advantage, so he was not seeking quick, short-term gains. He was concerned with putting all of his cookies in a single basket, so was inquiring about opinions on diversifying an allocation into the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO). To his credit, the poster realizes now that the Millennial FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) meme of “VOO and chill” might not be an appropriate direction to take in the current climate. Nevertheless, he acknowledges the long-term track record of the S&amp;P 500 and how it has benefited millions who have contributed to it regularly and let it compound to build wealth. As the poster has already established long term goals, assessing risk tolerance is probably the next factor to identify before finalizing his course of action. Taking a closer look at SCHD and VOO is probably a prudent step to accomplish this step. (All market quote details are as of the time of this writing.)

As one might expect, a number of the respondents agreed that some diversification was a good idea, as was the plan to invest a new contribution every week. Some of the the specifics included: Due to his youth, some suggested that it would behoove the poster to focus more on growth, and suggested SCHG (Schwab Large Cap Growth ETF), which has a superior ROI history over SCHD. In either case, reinvesting dividends to leverage compounding over the long haul was advised. Some lauded the dividend consideration, since the extra income could serve as a safety net in the event that the poster’s job were to be in jeopardy in the future. Another respondent agreed with adding VOO, but also including an ETF for international exposure so that in the event of a US economic downturn, there would be non-US holdings that could potentially offset any bearishness from the other holdings.

      "content": "Jensen Huang, who arguably runs the world&#8217;s most successful company, made only $1.5 million last year, according to the Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) proxy (PRE 14A). That is up $1 million from the year before. That pay was so low because most of his compensation comes from stock awards and “nonincentive compensation,” which can vary. In other words, the $1.5 million was all he could count on. It was his first base salary increase in a decade. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Last year, Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) Jensen Huang had his first base salary increase in a decade. Low compensation is not usually for CEOs who run the world’s most valuable companies. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Huang has a net worth of $98 billion, which makes him the 17th richest person in the world. Nvidia’s stock is down this year, so that figure has dropped $16 billion since January 1. Nvidia is the third most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of $2.7 trillion. The stock has dropped 17% so far this year. Most of Huang’s compensation for the recently reported year came from a stock award of $38 million. The problem with that award is that, if Nvidia’s stock drops, that sum could go down as well. Huang owns 3.5% of the company he founded in 1993. He turned it from a graphic chip company into the largest artificial intelligence (AI) company in the world. Huang’s low compensation is not usually for CEOs who run the world’s most valuable companies. Warren Buffett’s cash compensation last year was only $100,000. Because of his ownership in Berkshire Hathaway, his net worth is $166 billion, which makes him the sixth richest person in the world. From 1997 to 2011 when Steve Jobs retired as Apple’s CEO, his base cash compensation was only $1. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO today, had a base cash salary of $3 million last year. The low base salaries of highly successful CEOs are hard to explain. Do they tell investors that their pay is tied almost completely to performance? Or are they saying that to their employees? Huang and his board did not say.
