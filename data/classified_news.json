      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Buy the Rumor 1:41 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Bank of America has issued a report advising investors to buy the trade deal anticipation but sell the news. BofA Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett wrote, &#8220;Oversold equities have correctly front-run Q2 trade deals/lower tariffs. We expect ‘buy the expectation, sell the fact,’ stocks fade into the trade deals.&#8221; The White House is expected to meet with China officials on potentially reaching a trade agreement over the weekend. Stocks remain lower out of caution. Markets Hold Back 12:09 pm by Gerelyn Terzo China&#8217;s government officials have come out swinging against the White House, saying they strongly opposes what they described as &#8220;U.S. abuse&#8221; of reciprocal tariffs. Earlier today, President Trump revealed that he was willing to reduce tariffs on China imports to 80% from a triple-digit percentage level. Washington, D.C. and Beijing officials are set to come to the negotiating table this weekend. Stocks are lower on the trade deal uncertainty. Markets Reverse Course 10:52 am by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market has reversed course, leaving all three of the major stock market averages in the red after coming out of the gate higher on China trade deal hopes. Traders and investors appear to be playing it cautiously until the White House and Beijing sign on the dotted line. Market declines are modest, including a 0.07% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. At this rate, stocks are likely to continue meandering between positive and negative ground for now. Weekly Performance 9:44 am by Gerelyn Terzo The Nasdaq Composite is on pace for a fractional gain today and has advanced a more impressive 7.9% over the past month. Year-to-date, the tech-heavy index is still lower by 6%. Over the past five trading sessions, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) has gained 5% while Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) has lost 7.4%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are looking to end the week on a positive note after getting some good news on the trade war. President Trump revealed that he is willing to slash tariffs on China imports from a triple-digit percentage to 80%, saying that level seems appropriate as the White House gears up for talks with Beijing. Stocks appear to be cautiously optimistic on the development, with all three of the major stock market averages headed higher this morning. While China has been the wildcard, the Trump administration suggested that multiple agreements are being reached with U.S. trade partners, injecting further optimism into these markets. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green, led by the energy, consumer discretionary and technology sectors. Magnificent Seven stocks are lifting the Nasdaq Composite higher, including a 1% gain in Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) and 2.5% jump in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also getting a pop from Boeing (NYSE: BA) stock on a strong Dreamliners jet order from the British Airways parent company. BA stock is up 1.4%. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 114.55 (+0.26%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 102.00 (+0.57%) S&amp;P 500: Up 24.36 (+0.41%) Market Movers Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) might be a volatile play, but that is what it takes to trade as one of the leading tech stocks. As of yesterday, Palantir has muscled its way into the top 10 most valuable technology plays in the U.S. market, boasting a market capitalization of $281.1 billion. By way of comparison, Salesforce&#8217;s (NYSE: CRM) market cap currently hovers at a lesser $268.4 billion. PLTR stock is down 1% today on profit taking. Ad-tech platform The Trade Desk (Nasdaq: TTD) is soaring 22.8% today after reporting strong Q1 results. Revenue ballooned by 25% to $616 million. Earlier this month, RBC maintained a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $85 per share, reflecting upside potential of 41%. Lyft (Nasdaq: LYFT) stock is rising today after lifting its Q2 forecast and initiating a $750 million share buyback program. Most Wall Street analysts have a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the stock. Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) is taking a breather after announcing a blockbuster deal to acquire options trading platform Deribit in a $2.9 billion deal, thrusting it into the crypto derivatives realm.

      "title": "5 Dividend ETFs to Buy and Hold for a Lifetime of Passive Income",
      "content": "Dividend stock investing offers a reliable path to passive income and long-term wealth creation, making it a cornerstone for many portfolios. By owning shares in companies that pay regular dividends, investors gain consistent cash flow, often from stable, high-quality firms like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Dividends provide a hedge against market volatility, as payouts persist even during downturns, and reinvesting them can compound returns significantly over time. Moreover, dividend-paying stocks historically outperform non-dividend peers, with lower volatility. 24/7 Wall St. Insights: Dividend stock investing has proven a reliable path for investors to gather immense wealth over time. Dividend ETFs bolster those results by investing in hundreds of dividend-paying stocks, offering instant diversification and minimizing single-stock risk. Sit back and let dividends do the heavy lifting for a simple, steady path to serious wealth creation over time. Grab a free copy of “2 Legendary High-Yield Dividend Stocks“ now. Dividend-paying exchange-traded funds (ETFs) enhance these benefits by pooling dozens or hundreds of such stocks, offering instant diversification, reduced single-stock risk, and low expense ratios. In 2025’s uncertain market, marked by tariffs and persistent inflation, dividend ETFs provide resilience and income stability. Pursuing this strategy ensures steady returns and growth, making it ideal for both novice and seasoned investors seeking financial security. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Any discussion of dividend ETFs must begin with Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). It is a top-tier dividend ETF, tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index with around 100 high-quality stocks like Lockheed-Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), each boasting more than 10 years of dividend growth. The ETF&#8217;s 3.7% yield and ultra-low 0.06% expense ratio make it cost-effective while limiting sector exposure to no more than 25% ensures diversification. SCHD’s 11.4% annualized return over a decade reflects its balance of income and growth. Because SCHD focuses on financially sound companies, the dividend ETF mitigates risks, offering investors stability. For those seeking high yield and reliability, SCHD stock is a must-own ETF for lifelong passive income. Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM) The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSE:VYM) tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, holding 589 stocks like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), with no stock exceeding 4% of the portfolio. VYM&#8217;s 2.7% yield and 0.06% expense ratio deliver strong value, while its 13.3% five-year annualized return highlights its consistency. VYM also offers broad diversification across sectors like energy and financials, reducing volatility, making it ideal for conservative investors. With tariff&#8217;s top-of-mind for investors these days, the ETF&#8217;s U.S.-focused holdings provide resilience against global disruptions. Its proven track record and low costs makes VYM a foundational ETF for steady dividend income and long-term wealth building. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSEARCA:VIG) targets companies with over 10 years of dividend increases, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and holds 338 stocks in its portfolio. The ETF&#8217;s 1.8% yield is lower, but its focus on dividend growth drives an 11.2% annualized return over the past decade. VIG&#8217;s 0.05% expense ratio is also among the lowest, maximizing investor returns. The Vanguard dividend ETF’s tech- and consumer-heavy portfolio suits investors prioritizing capital appreciation alongside income. And for investors looking for exposure to stable, growing firms, VIG cushions against economic uncertainty. It&#8217;s another ETF sporting a blend of growth and income, making it a versatile choice for investors seeking a balance of dividends and upside potential. iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO) The iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:DGRO) tracks the Morningstar US Dividend Growth Index, holding over 400 stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), and emphasizes its consistent dividend growth. DGRO sports a 2.3% yield and 0.08% expense ratio, offering a balanced income stream and a 16.4% annualized return over five years. The ETF&#8217;s diversified sector exposure, including financials and healthcare, minimizes risk. In today&#8217;s volatile market, the ETF&#8217;s focus on resilient, dividend-growing companies counters the extreme swings the market is experiencing. DGRO’s low cost and steady performance make it an excellent choice for investors seeking dependable income with moderate growth in a challenging economic landscape. ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL) The last dividend ETF to consider is ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NYSEARCA:NOBL), which tracks the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. It holds over 60 stocks, each with over 25 years of dividend increases, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and C.H. Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW). With a 2.5% yield and 0.35% expense ratio, it reflects NOBL&#8217;s premium quality, which has generated 14.5% annualized returns over the last five years. The ETF&#8217;s equal-weighted approach also reduces concentration risk, while its focus on elite dividend payers ensures stability. NOBL’s defensive holdings, with a long history of thriving amid uncertainty, offer investors reliable payouts. For those prioritizing quality and consistency, NOBL’s proven resilience makes it a stellar long-term holding for passive income.

Rates Unchanged but Risks Remain 2:12 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The Dow has recovered, reversing a 200-point loss after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged. Policymakers kept the range of short-term borrowing rates between 4.25% and 4.5%, as widely expected. In commentary, the Fed pointed to heightened economic uncertainty, including rising risks around inflation and unemployment. Policymakers also introduced the idea of stagflation, causing the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to withhold any gains.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 are also posting fractional gains. Markets are encouraged by plans for U.S. and China officials to come to the negotiating table on tariffs ahead of comments by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell later today. Economists largely expect the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged. Bank of America has warned that cutting interest rates may not be a top priority for the Fed, suggesting that while the markets are pricing in a trio of rate cuts in 2025, they aren&#8217;t likely to begin until mid-summer despite urging by President Trump to begin rate cuts sooner.

      "content": "Jensen Huang, who arguably runs the world&#8217;s most successful company, made only $1.5 million last year, according to the Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) proxy (PRE 14A). That is up $1 million from the year before. That pay was so low because most of his compensation comes from stock awards and “nonincentive compensation,” which can vary. In other words, the $1.5 million was all he could count on. It was his first base salary increase in a decade. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Last year, Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) Jensen Huang had his first base salary increase in a decade. Low compensation is not usually for CEOs who run the world’s most valuable companies. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Huang has a net worth of $98 billion, which makes him the 17th richest person in the world. Nvidia’s stock is down this year, so that figure has dropped $16 billion since January 1. Nvidia is the third most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of $2.7 trillion. The stock has dropped 17% so far this year. Most of Huang’s compensation for the recently reported year came from a stock award of $38 million. The problem with that award is that, if Nvidia’s stock drops, that sum could go down as well. Huang owns 3.5% of the company he founded in 1993. He turned it from a graphic chip company into the largest artificial intelligence (AI) company in the world. Huang’s low compensation is not usually for CEOs who run the world’s most valuable companies. Warren Buffett’s cash compensation last year was only $100,000. Because of his ownership in Berkshire Hathaway, his net worth is $166 billion, which makes him the sixth richest person in the world. From 1997 to 2011 when Steve Jobs retired as Apple’s CEO, his base cash compensation was only $1. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO today, had a base cash salary of $3 million last year. The low base salaries of highly successful CEOs are hard to explain. Do they tell investors that their pay is tied almost completely to performance? Or are they saying that to their employees? Huang and his board did not say.
