      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Markets Hope Nvidia Will Lift Sentiment 1:51 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets are hoping Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) will revive sentiment next week, as the company prepares to release its highly anticipated Q1 results on Wednesday, May 28. Despite a 1% dip year-to-date in the share price, Nvidia&#8217;s underlying fundamentals remain robust based on its most recent performance. The company has the potential to shift the focus from tariffs back to earnings, which have largely beaten expectations so far. Most Wall Street analysts maintain a buy rating on NVDA stock, projecting an average 12-month price target of $164, a considerable upside from current levels of $132. Nvidia&#8217;s upcoming Q1 report is expected to shed light on the impact of tariffs implemented in early 2025. This follows strong Q4 results where the company surpassed Wall Street estimates on both revenue and earnings. At the time, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated, “AI is advancing at light speed as agentic AI and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries.” NVDA stock is currently off fractionally while the SPX ETF is off by 0.37%. Tariff Tall Tale 12:24 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Wedbush analyst Dan Ives pushed back against President Donald Trump&#8217;s new tariff targeting Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) iPhones, basically calling domestic production a tall tale. &#8220;We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the [U.S.] is a fairy tale that is not feasible,&#8221; Ives stated in a report. Trump threatened that Apple could face tariffs of 25% or more on iPhones made outside the USA. Apple recently revealed its intentions to redirect production of its iPhones from China to India. Apple stock is down 2.5% today, and the SPX ETF is lower by 0.84%. Fed Uncertainty 10:45 am by Gerelyn Terzo Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee cautioned Friday that President Donald Trump’s latest tariff moves have complicated monetary policy decisions and likely pushed back any interest rate changes. The Fed previously revealed its intentions to lower interest rates twice in 2025. Goolsbee told CNBC, &#8220;Everything’s always on the table. But I feel like the bar for me is a little higher for action in any direction while we’re waiting to get some clarity.&#8221; This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. A sharp sell-off gripped the markets this Friday morning, with all three major stock market averages surrendering ground. The week is set to conclude on a sour note, following President Trump’s recent threat to levy a steep 50% tariff on the EU, a measure that could be implemented in the coming days. In a potentially encouraging sign, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has trimmed its losses almost in half, while both the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 have similarly come off their worst levels. The majority of economic sectors are trading lower, with consumer discretionary and technology stocks taking the hardest hits. The SPX ETF is lower by 0.84%, while the S&amp;P 500 is on pace for a 2.7% weekly decline. Bond yields are declining as the trade war escalates, bringing a volatile week for the bond market to a close. Stock market volatility has also reemerged, highlighted by a 25% increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is facing renewed pressure, with President Trump warning that iPhones produced outside the U.S. could be subject to substantial tariffs, causing Apple stock to drop 2% today. Yet, in a bright spot among the Magnificent Seven, prominent Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is optimistic about Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), boosting his price target on the electric vehicle manufacturer to $500, suggesting a 49% upside potential, alongside an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 253.11 (-0.60%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 182.34 (-0.94%) S&amp;P 500: Down 44.23 (-0.77%) Market Movers Nuclear stocks are defying the downward trend today, gaining ground as the Trump administration signals favorable conditions for the industry. Companies including Oklo (NYSE: OKLO), NuScale (NYSE: SMR), and Constellation Energy (Nasdaq: CEG) are all advancing, led by a double-digit percentage gain for OKLO. Quantum computing stock IonQ (NYSE: IONQ), however, is down as much as 4.7% today, following yesterday&#8217;s rally that saw its share price close above $45. In earnings developments, Intuit (NYSE: INTU) is gaining 8.6% today while Deckers (NYSE: DECK) is sinking 21.7% on a Wall Street downgrade following disappointing results on tariff impacts.

      "title": "As China’s Dominance Dims, India Begins to Shine – The Time to Consider Investment Opportunities is Now",
      "content": "Key Points As US tariffs hit, China&#8217;s manufacturing sector feels the bite Geopolitics began the slide, many multinationals have been looking for a new low cost country/region Risks are still present, but India&#8217;s advancements over the past 30 years have them well positioned Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset&#8217;s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don&#8217;t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) A seismic shift has transformed global manufacturing in recent years, with US and EU companies increasingly moving production from China to India. Accelerated by President Trump’s use of tariffs as trade weapons, this movement began a few years ago as geopolitical tensions and economic pressures began to raise concerns about supply chain resilience. India’s proactive policies have served to drive this trend toward supply chain diversification. While India has made remarkable progress over the past three decades, and holds vast potential as a manufacturing hub, infrastructure gaps and regulatory complexities present challenges. The primary driver is escalating friction with China. U.S.-China trade wars have imposed steep tariffs on Chinese goods, pushing companies to seek alternatives. From 2018 to 2022, U.S. goods imports from China dropped 10% (inflation-adjusted), while imports from India soared 44%, per trade data. Concerns over intellectual property theft and supply chain risks exposed during COVID-19 further fueled this shift. China’s rising labor and production costs have also eroded its edge in labor-intensive sectors like textiles and electronics, prompting companies to explore cost-competitive alternatives. India has emerged as a prime destination, propelled by initiatives like “Make in India” and Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes. These offer tax breaks (e.g., a 17% corporate tax rate for new manufacturing firms), subsidies to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), and a stable legal system rooted in British common law, safeguarding intellectual property. India’s youthful workforce (median age 28) and 1.4 billion-strong consumer market enhance its appeal. Apple, for example, has ramped up iPhone production in India, with Foxconn investing $1.5 billion in Tamil Nadu to supply the U.S. market. India’s share of Apple’s iPhone output grew from 2% to 5% between 2021 and 2022, with goals to hit 25%. Other giants like Dell, Nike, Intel, and Nippon Steel are also shifting production, with over 90% of North American manufacturers surveyed by BCG reporting some relocation from China in the past five years. Yet despite India’s appeal, challenges do remain. India’s infrastructure lags, with only 5% of roads classified as highways, causing logistical bottlenecks. Regulatory red tape hinders operations, with just 55% of companies reporting seamless production shifts. Manufacturing costs in India can also run 5–10% higher than in China due to import duties on components. India faces competition from Vietnam, a leader in electronics, and Mexico, advantaged by its proximity to the U.S. Companies and investors must navigate these hurdles to ensure profitability. This shift opens doors for entrepreneurs and businesses. Investors can target Indian firms or ETFs in booming sectors like electronics and semiconductors, which attracted $16 billion in manufacturing FDI from 2020 to 2023. Content creators can monetize blogs or videos on India’s manufacturing surge through ads or sponsorships. Consulting services offer another path, providing market research or regulatory guidance for firms entering India. Businesses can also develop logistics or compliance solutions to address operational challenges. The pivot from China to India reflects geopolitical, economic, and logistical realities. India’s policies and demographic strengths position it as a rising manufacturing powerhouse, but infrastructure and regulatory hurdles require careful strategy. Opportunities in investment, content creation, and consulting abound for those who can navigate India’s complexities with precision. Investors can explore top Indian companies listed on U.S. exchanges, such as HDFC Bank (NYSE: HDB), Infosys (NYSE: INFY), or MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ: MMYT). For broader exposure, the iShares MSCI India ETF (NASDAQ: INDA) tracks the MSCI India Index, covering roughly 85% of India’s large and mid-cap equity market.

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Apple in Crosshairs 2:11 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock has a target on its back. Wall Street firm Needham has downgraded shares of the Big Tech stock to &#8220;hold&#8221; from &#8220;buy,&#8221; arguing the stock is hovering at frothy levels. Needham also pulled its $225 price target, noting a $170-$180 range would be an acceptable entry point. Apple shares were largely unchanged today, while the SPY ETF is up 0.26%. Citi Takes Aim at CEG 11:35 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street analyst firm Citi has reduced its rating on Constellation Energy (NYSE: CEG) shares in response to the utility&#8217;s long-term power agreement with Mag 7 stock Meta (Nasdaq: META). Analysts at Citi now classify CEG stock as high-risk, arguing that the company will forgo the opportunity for premium pricing on its nuclear-generated electricity. They have set a price target of $318. CEG shares are falling 3% today after yesterday&#8217;s rock-star performance. The SPY ETF is up 0.16% as of mid-morning trading. S&amp;P Outlook Looking Up 10:05 am by Gerelyn Terzo With the first half of 2025 almost behind us, Wall Street analysts are actively revising their year-end market forecasts. Most recently, Barclays has adjusted its S&amp;P 500 year-end outlook upward by nearly 3% to 6,050, a notable increase from its previous target of 5,900. Beyond Barclays, other prominent analyst firms like Deutsche Bank and RBC have also recently elevated their 2025 S&amp;P 500 targets, signaling a positively shifting consensus for the broader market&#8217;s direction. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Market optimism is overriding underwhelming labor market data, with all three major stock averages climbing higher as of morning trading. Yesterday, equities staged a turnaround, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its fourth consecutive winning session, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 also advanced. Today, most economic sectors are in positive territory, with technology leading the charge with a 1.48% gain. The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) is up 0.11%) Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) has surpassed Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) to reclaim its position as the world&#8217;s most valuable company, now boasting a market capitalization of $3.45 trillion. Traders and investors are betting whether NVDA stock can clinch new highs soon. Private Payrolls Slow, Sparking Rate Cut Calls Private sector hiring lost significant momentum in May, with payrolls expanding by a mere 37,000 jobs. These results not only fell short of April&#8217;s 60,000 gain but also missed the Dow Jones forecast of 110,000 by a wide margin. In a sobering sign for the labor market, it marked the lowest monthly job creation from the ADP report in over two years. Meanwhile, the picture for wages remained largely static compared with the prior month&#8217;s results. Following this weaker-than-expected private sector jobs data, President Trump is increasing pressure on Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, asserting that the Fed chairman should have already taken this action. Discount Retailers Rally, ON Semi Recovers Dollar General (NYSE: DG) is racing ahead by 15.8% today, extending yesterday&#8217;s gains on the back of a positive full-year outlook. Fellow discount retailer Dollar Tree (NYSE: DLTR) is also gaining 6% today, buoyed by similarly upbeat guidance. ON Semi (Nasdaq: ON) is climbing 2.7% today, recouping some recently lost ground. This comes after Morgan Stanley analysts recently indicated that much of the negative sentiment is already factored into ON&#8217;s stock price.

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Bonds on Sale 1:19 pm The Treasury&#8217;s auction of 5-year notes has concluded. Paying 4% interest, the $70 billion in notes sold at an average yield of 4.07%, indicating a small 1.7% discount to face value. At the Right Price, Investors Still Love T-Bills 11:52 am $70 billion worth of 5-year Treasury notes are about to go on auction, and demand looks healthy even as yields rise. (Which makes sense. Higher yields imply lower prices, and everybody likes a bargain, even when we&#8217;re talking about U.S. government debt). 2-year Treasuries went on sale yesterday, and demand was described similarly as &#8220;solid.&#8221; The Dow is still down 0.3%. Apple and iPhones in Focus 11:17 am Dow component company Apple (Nasdaq: APPL) is in focus today as Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah reiterates a hold rating and $215 price target on the tech stock. &#8220;Tariff actions&#8221; are pulling demand for iPhones forward into the March and June quarters as investors hedge against the risk President Trump is serious about imposing 25% tariffs on imported iPhones. Further out, the analyst is looking ahead to the expected iPhone 17 launch. Apple has raised its estimates for iPhone 17 shipments in Q4, and iPhone average selling prices are also moving higher. Apple stock is up about 0.5% today. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average has turned red, now down 0.3%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. President Trump alarmed investors last week when he threatened to impose a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union as early as June 1. On Monday, the President backtracked, saying the tariffs won&#8217;t actually go into effect until July 9. Even more optimistically, he confirmed efforts are afoot to &#8220;quickly establish meeting dates&#8221; with EU negotiators to lower tariff barriers and &#8220;open up the European Nations for Trade with the United States of America.&#8221; In more troubling news, there&#8217;s trouble brewing at the White House today as Elon Musk, who spearheaded President Trump&#8217;s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts, says he&#8217;s &#8220;disappointed&#8221; with &#8220;the massive spending bill&#8221; that the President sent to Congress last week, and that the House of Representatives has now passed. The bill, says Musk, &#8220;increases the budget deficit&#8221; and &#8220;undermines the work that the Doge team is doing.&#8221; Not good. Nevertheless, after soaring 700 points yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) is up another 65 points today for a nearly 0.2 % gain. Earnings Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (NYSE: ANF) reported an earnings beat today, $1.59 per share earned in Q1, which was $0.20 better than expected. The retail clothing chain stock is up nearly 27% currently. Macy&#8217;s (NYSE: M) &#8220;beat earnings by a penny,&#8221; reporting $0.16 per share in Q1 profit. Macy&#8217;s stock is down almost 4%. Both companies cut guidance after reporting their beats. Abercrombie predicts it will earn between $9.50 and $10.50 this year. Macy&#8217;s says full year earnings will range from $1.60 to $2. Both earnings ranges are broadly below analyst forecasts, implying no more earnings beats this year. Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods (NYSE: DKS) meanwhile reported $3.37 per share this morning. The number beat analyst forecasts. Even better, guidance at Dick&#8217;s calls for $13.80 to $14.40 per share earned this year. At the midpoint, that&#8217;s less than Wall Street&#8217;s forecast $14.34, but the &#8220;$14.40&#8221; number at least implies there&#8217;s a chance Dick&#8217;s will beat estimates this year.

In a related move, OpenAI is reportedly entrusting its creative and design leadership to Ive and his design firm, LoveFrom. Ive, widely recognized as the visionary behind the iPhone, alongside OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, will focus on crafting consumer devices and other projects that aim to shape the future look and feel of artificial intelligence. NFLX Stock Clinches New All-Time High Despite Analyst Downgrade 11:45 am by Gerelyn Terzo Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX) stock is rising 1.5% today to above $1,200 per share for a market cap of $514.3 billion, clinching a fresh all-time high. JPMorgan analysts are sending mixed messages, downgrading NFLX shares to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;overweight&#8221; but raising the price target to $1,220 per share, reflecting about 1% upside potential from current levels. The SPY ETF is currently down by 0.18%. UnitedHealth Woes Grow 10:30 am by Gerelyn Terzo UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) stock is experiencing a further decline today, dropping 4.3% and adding to its recent struggles. Analysts at HSBC recently downgraded the healthcare giant, citing earnings risks and suggesting that any recovery for the battered stock could be &#8220;delayed.&#8221; This follows the company&#8217;s CEO stepping down in recent weeks. CFRA was an early mover, downgrading UNH shares to a &#8220;sell&#8221; back in Q1 and sounding an early warning on the stock. Overall, UNH stock has fallen 39.3% year-to-date. The SPY ETF remains under pressure and is down 0.51% at last check. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Markets are widening their losses today, with all three major stock market averages trading lower right out of the gate. Bond yields are on the rise, pushing the 30-year Treasury yield past the 5% mark. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is sinking by over 300 points, while both the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are each shedding approximately 0.55%. The SPY ETF trading lower by 0.45%. Bucking the downward trend, Google parent company Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) stands out, climbing 1.8% today. The tech giant, currently hosting its I/O developer event in California, has showcased new innovations like Android XR glasses and real-time translation in Google Meets, and hinted at a paid subscription tier for AI users. Meanwhile, Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang expressed approval for the Trump administration&#8217;s updated curbs on AI chip exports to China. Discount retailer Target (NYSE: TGT) delivered disappointing quarterly results, including a 2.8% slide in sales. The retailer further lowered its full-year outlook, attributing the cautious forecast to consumer uncertainty surrounding tariffs, and is now bracing for a low single-digit sales decline for the current fiscal year. Consequently, Target&#8217;s stock is losing 6.8% today. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 345.16 (-0.81%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 38.21 (-0.20%) S&amp;P 500: Down 30.26 (-0.51%) Market Movers Retailers are on the move. TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX), parent of brands like TJ Maxx, managed to surpass Wall Street&#8217;s sales estimates but opted to keep its full-year guidance unchanged. TJX appears to be benefiting from the current economic climate as consumers adjust spending habits and increasingly opt for lower-priced brand items. In other individual stock movements, Palo Alto Networks (Nasdaq: PANW) is down 6.9% today following its Q3 results. Despite this, Morningstar analysts suggest the cybersecurity firm is gaining significant market share. Super Micro Computer (Nasdaq: SMCI) is advancing 2.7% as the company weighs investing in a U.S. expansion. Fair Isaac Corp (NYSE: FICO) has plunged 11% today after a federal housing official raised questions about its pricing model. This comes in a significant week for the housing sector, with key existing and new home sales data anticipated later.

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Jamie Dimon on the Risk of Inflation and Deflation 3:23 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets have recouped most of their losses, with the SPX now down a modest 0.03%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon believes the risks around the threat of both inflation and deflation have yet to surface in stock market values. He said at an event in New York, “We have huge deficits; we have what I consider almost complacent central banks. You all think they can manage all this. I don’t think” they can&#8230;“My own view is people feel pretty good because you haven’t [yet] seen effective tariffs&#8230;The market came down 10%, [it’s] back up 10%; that’s an extraordinary amount of complacency.&#8221; Ray Dalio Comments on US Debt 11:58 am by Gerelyn Terzo Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, reportedly raised a flag that Moody&#8217;s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating misses a crucial point regarding the vulnerability of U.S. Treasuries. According to Dalio, the credit agency&#8217;s analysis fails to account for the inherent risk of the federal government resorting to money printing to service its massive debt. While Treasury yields rise, the markets remain under pressure, including a 0.17% decline in the SPX ETF. Retail Stocks in Focus 10:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo This week, the market&#8217;s focus pivots to corporate earnings, with reports due from major players like Home Depot (NYSE: HD), Target (NYSE: TGT) and TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX). Notably, TJX stock has already climbed 11% this year so far. Comparable store sales figures will be under close examination amid ongoing high interest rates as well as signs of cooling inflation. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are narrowing their declines in the face of a U.S. debt downgrade by one of the credit rating agencies. Moody&#8217;s lowered its view of U.S. debt by a single notch to to Aa1, down from the highest possible rating. Moody&#8217;s blamed the persistent budget deficit and high interest rates, a view challenged by President Trump, who affirmed global confidence in the U.S. economy. The credit downgrade adds insult to injury following a week in which the S&amp;P 500 advanced 5%. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC he predicts one interest rate cut in 2025 as the economy continues to stave off a recession. The central bank has tipped its hand to a possible two rate cuts this year. Today&#8217;s credit downgrade sent Treasury yields higher, with the 30-year Treasury surpassing the 5% threshold, and weighed heavily on equities. While the SPX ETF is currently down slightly, the three major averages are showing signs of resilience, paring back their earlier losses as the morning progresses. The broader technology sector is currently down 1.4%. The prominent Magnificent Seven stocks are mostly in the red, including a 2.8% decline in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny of its proposed AI partnership with China&#8217;s Alibaba. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 44.18 (-0.10%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 103.54 (-0.54%) S&amp;P 500: Down 20.36 (-0.34%) Market Movers Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is down 2.3% after announcing potential price increases due to tariffs, a move countered by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent&#8217;s suggestion that the retailer will &#8220;absorb some of the tariffs.&#8221; Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) has seen a 3.8% decline but remains close to its recent high of $130.18. Novavax (Nasdaq: NVAX) is a significant gainer, soaring 25.9% following regulatory approval for its COVID-19 vaccine. Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) shares are lower by 4.4% on the back of an analyst downgrade. Take-Two Interactive Software (Nasdaq: TTWO) is bucking the trend, climbing 3.7% after a price target increase from Wedbush Securities.

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended The Magnificent 7 Could See Even More Upside 11:38 am While today’s 1,000-point Dow rally has been impressive, similar days may be ahead. When the U.S. and China meet again in the next few weeks, they’ll work out a bigger agreement on trade. While nothing has been set in stone with that just yet, markets are still celebrating today’s trade breakthrough. Here’s where that currently stands. Under the 90-day pause, both countries lowered tariffs by 115 percentage points to 10%. The 20% fentanyl-related tariff from the U.S. remains in place, so most Chinese goods face a 30% rate in total, down from 145% previously, as noted by CNBC. The Magnificent 7 Are Just Starting to Rally Back 10:50 am As of May, the Magnificent 7 lost about $6 trillion in value since their peak in late 2024. Also, at its trough, the Roundhill BIG Tech ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS) – which tracks the Magnificent 7 plummeted from about $56 to a low of $39. However, thanks to the latest U.S.-China news, the ETF is quickly rebounding higher. Making the Mag 7 even more attractive, analysts believe they can easily beat the S&amp;P 500 in earnings this year. Plus, with valuations off their 2024 peaks, investors are coming back to the table to feast. The U.S. and China have finally agreed to a temporary – but significant easing of tariffs. In fact, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. tariffs on China will drop 115 percentage points to 30%. China’s levies on U.S. imports will drop to 10%. More information on specifics can be found in the Joint Statement on U.S. China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva at WhiteHouse.gov. As a result of the agreement, the Dow Jones is up about 1,050 points. The NASDAQ is up 663, as the S&amp;P 500 adds 156 points. Even better, it’s boosting the Magnificent 7 stocks. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is up 5.6%, or $11.25. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is up 1%, or by $4.80. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) is up about 3%, or by $4.71. com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is up 7.4% or by $14.55. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is up 4%, or by $4.80. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) I up 6.5%, or by $38.73. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is up 7%, or by $21.23.
