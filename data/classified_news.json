With Apple emerging as a direct competitor to Musk&rsquo;s Starlink service, the two tech giants are now vying for control over spectrum rights&mdash;essential airwaves that enable mobile communications.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"\" data-start=\"455\" data-end=\"509\">Apple&rsquo;s Satellite Ambitions and Starlink&rsquo;s Pushback</h2>\r\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"511\" data-end=\"920\">Apple&rsquo;s primary partner in satellite services, Globalstar, is currently responsible for providing off-the-grid connectivity to iPhones. However, industry analysts suggest that Globalstar alone may not be sufficient to meet Apple&rsquo;s long-term satellite goals. SpaceX, which operates the expansive Starlink satellite network, holds a major competitive edge due to its larger satellite fleet and broader coverage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"922\" data-end=\"1213\">The growing rivalry escalated as Musk reportedly lobbied federal regulators to delay Apple&rsquo;s satellite expansion.
