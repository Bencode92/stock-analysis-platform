Despite a negative earnings yield of <strong>-0.93%</strong>, the company's enterprise value to operating cash flow ratio of <strong>19.1</strong> shows that investors are willing to pay for its operating cash flow.

(<a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/financial-summary/FC\">NYSE:FC</a>) is a key player in the organizational performance improvement sector. The company specializes in providing content, training, and tools designed to drive systemic changes in human behavior. FC operates within the Zacks Consulting Services industry, competing with other firms that offer similar consulting and training services.</p>\n\n<p>On July 2, 2025, FC reported earnings per share (EPS) of <strong>$0.18</strong>, significantly exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a <strong>$0.08</strong> loss per share. This represents an impressive earnings surprise of <strong>325%</strong>. However, it's important to note that this EPS is a decrease from the <strong>$0.43</strong> reported in the same quarter last year, highlighting a year-over-year decline.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the earnings beat, FC's revenue for the quarter was <strong>$67.12 million</strong>, slightly below the estimated $67.5 million. This revenue figure also marks a decrease from the <strong>$73.37 million</strong> reported in the same quarter of the previous year. Over the past four quarters, FC has exceeded consensus EPS estimates three times but has only surpassed revenue estimates once.</p>\n\n<p>FC's financial metrics provide further insight into its market valuation. The company has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately <strong>16.28</strong>, indicating how the market values its earnings. Its price-to-sales ratio is about <strong>1.00</strong>, suggesting that the market value is roughly equal to its sales. The enterprise value to sales ratio is approximately <strong>0.88</strong>, reflecting the company's valuation in relation to its sales, including debt and excluding cash.</p>\n\n<p>The company's financial health is also evident in its debt-to-equity ratio of about <strong>0.057</strong>, indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to equity. Additionally, the current ratio of approximately <strong>0.90</strong> suggests FC's ability to cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of FC's financial standing and market position.</p>",

      "title": "I Found the Best Credit Card – 4.5X Rewards with Instant Redemption!",
      "content": "If you stopped 100 people on the street and asked them about the best credit card, you&#8217;d likely get 100 different answers. Whether it&#8217;s a travel card or a cash-back card, the debate over the best credit card is similar to the debate between Mac and PC, or Android and iPhone. The good news is that there are numerous credit cards available with benefits that cater to everyone. Key Points There are numerous great credit cards available, but a select few stand out above the rest. There is no question Reddit is in love with this particular card, but there is a giant caveat. The hope is that, regardless of which card you use, you pay it off every month. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) One Redditor posting in r/CreditCards claims to have found the secret credit card sauce. With 4.5x benefits on every purchase, they hope that they have found the one and only card they will ever need. As the card can also be used with Apple Pay, which is available everywhere they live, it’s good news all around. US Bank Altitude Reserve This isn&#8217;t the first time this particular subreddit has come out in favor of the US Bank Altitude Reserve card. There is no question this card is wildly popular with Redditors and US Bank customers in general. With 5x points on prepaid hotel and car rentals, 3x on eligible travel, and 1x on eligible purchases, there are definite benefits to using this card. In fact, the Redditor specifically calls out the 3x bonus points for mobile wallet payments, which is a definite bonus. As a Chicago resident, the Redditor notes that Apple Pay is available everywhere, allowing them to rack up 3x points every day. Of course, it wasn’t just Apple Pay that gave this card a little extra limelight. It was also the $325 annual statement credit for travel and dining purchases. The same applies to Priority Pass at airport lounges worldwide. The same goes for the $120 statement credit for either TSA PreCheck or Global Entry. Add in a concierge service, car rental discounts, and premium benefits at luxury hotel brands, and the benefits keep on coming. Unfortunately, there is one problem, as the US Bank Altitude Reserve card is no longer available to new customers. As of November 2024, the bank stopped taking new customers, while existing customers can continue to use their cards. Of course, the Reddit comment section is filled with individuals who want this card to return. They’ve seen posts like this one before in r/CreditCards, and they want in on the Reserve card fun. Best Alternative Still Available The difficult reality is that this card was so good that the prevailing thought was it was a loss leader, hence why it was shut down. The next big challenge is that there is near-universal agreement that no other card offers the same mix of benefits. This makes it pretty challenging to find a great alternative you can still sign up for right now. All of this said, the card that comes the closest, according to a large percentage of Redditors, is the Capital One Venture X card. Rest assured that these two cards are definitely not the same, but it&#8217;s about the closest comparison most people are comfortable with. Where the Venture X card does stand out is with the $300 annual travel card and $120 Global Entry or TSA PreCheck credit. Not to mention, you&#8217;ll receive 10,000 bonus miles, equivalent to $100 in travel, on your card&#8217;s first anniversary. As for purchases, you earn 10 times the points on all hotel and rental car purchases made through the Capital One Travel portal. Unfortunately, flights and vacation rentals only qualify for 5x points, while all other purchases only provide 2x points. On the bright side, you do get easy access to both Capital One lounges and 1,300 Priority Passes lounges worldwide. Make Sure to Maximize Your Rewards At the end of the day, what’s most important is to ensure you&#8217;re maximizing your rewards. Regardless of which card you have, consider setting up automatic payments to help keep your balance low. You should also regularly review your credit report to make sure there are no inaccuracies that could affect your credit limit down the line. Most importantly, ensure that you strategically use your travel points and cash-back cards to maximize value. In the same way you want to look for travel bonuses, the same goes for 5% rotating category cash-back credit cards, where you enjoy extra bonuses every quarter.

      "title": "Remplir sales surge: Orthocell CEO interview",
      "content": "Orthocell Ltd CEO and managing director Paul Anderson earlier this week spoke with Proactive after the company reported record revenue for the June 2025 quarter, citing strong uptake of its flagship Remplir nerve repair product. Highlights The company said quarterly revenue reached A$2.73 million, representing a 22.80 percent increase compared to the previous quarter. Orthocell highlighted that this growth reflected continued adoption across Australia, with more than 206 surgeons now using Remplir in over 166 hospitals. Anderson told investors that the commercial launch in Australia has been a “spectacular” success. The company noted that none of the reported revenue was generated in the United States, where it recently completed its first procedure. Orthocell said it has established a distribution network in the US, comprising 14 distributors and more than 100 representatives across 21 states. The company expects this infrastructure will drive further growth as the product is adopted by additional hospitals and surgeons. Anderson stated that preparations over the past two years have positioned the company to scale internationally. He said, “It leaves us in such a strong position,” adding that the lessons learned in Australia will inform the US commercial rollout. Potential catalysts for investors include increased US revenue contributions, further hospital engagements, and broader clinical use of Remplir. Orthocell also expects rising adoption rates in Australia to continue contributing to revenue momentum over the coming financial year. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL, ETR:APC) continues to show strength in its Services business, with global App Store revenue estimated to have increased by 12% year-over-year in June, according to Bank of America analysts. The firm maintains its ‘Buy’ rating on Apple and $235 price target, pointing to strong capital returns, leadership in on-device AI, and ongoing revenue diversification within the App Store. Bank of America estimates App Store revenues reached $8.4 billion in fiscal Q3 2025, up 11.5% year-over-year, based on developer-level data from SensorTower. Downloads across iPhone and iPad rose 4.3% year-over-year to 8.6 billion in the quarter, with dollars per download increasing to $0.98, a 6.9% improvement. “For the month of June, App Store revenue increased 12% year-over-year globally, outpacing app store download growth of 3% year-over-year,” analysts noted. Despite regulatory scrutiny and the Epic Games ruling, Bank of America analysts say there's no evidence of a material impact to App Store monetization. “We do not observe any indication of adverse impact on app store revenue,” they wrote, even as trends toward off-app payments become more common. The bank believes investor concerns around the ruling’s severity “appear to be moot.” The report also highlights a notable shift in App Store revenue mix, with gaming losing ground to other categories. While games still generate the largest share of revenue, their portion has dropped from over 50% to 45% in fiscal Q3. “Games remain as the leader of the global app store revenue by category list, though their share has declined,” the analysts wrote. Categories such as Photo & Video, Lifestyle, Books, Education, and Utilities each gained 100 basis points year-over-year, while Productivity jumped 200 basis points, the largest gain of any group. “This mix shift, albeit not as meaningful currently, may signal legacy game developers to diversify into non-games or expand existing in-app purchasing options,” Bank of America wrote. “We believe either scenario in the ensuing years could be a long-term tailwind for Apple’s App Store revenue.” Additionally, the top 10 developers globally now account for nearly a quarter of Apple’s year-to-date App Store revenue, according to the firm’s analysis. This group includes both single-app players like ChatGPT, FUNFLY, and Tinder, as well as diversified developers like Tencent, Google, and TikTok, which maintain broad app portfolios spanning entertainment, utilities, and productivity. Impact of US-Vietnam trade deal Meanwhile, proposed tariffs on goods exported from Vietnam into the US will have a minimal impact on Apple, analysts at UBS believe. While Vietnam has become an increasingly important part of the tech giant’s supply chain diversification strategy, the analysts highlighted that the region still accounts for only a small fraction, roughly 5%, of Apple’s global supply chain footprint. “Given the relatively small physical footprint and focus on ancillary products, a 20% tariff on imports into the US will have a negligible impact on Apple margins in our view,” they wrote. They see the financial impact as a “gross margin rounding error.” UBS estimates that approximately 35 Apple suppliers operate around 38 discrete facilities in Vietnam, concentrated in areas like Bac Giang, Bac Ninh, Hai Phong, Phu Tho, and Vinh Phuc. In comparison, mainland China still dominates the supply chain, representing over 35% of Apple’s supplier locations globally. UBS has a ‘Neutral’ rating and $210 price target on Apple, based on about 28 times their calendar year 2026 earnings per share (EPS) estimate, reflecting a higher equity risk premium and interest rates. “We note our financial projections reflect the impact of the proposed tariffs in the June quarter but not beyond given the fluid nature of the discussions,” they wrote. Shares of Apple finished Thursday’s trading session at about $213.",

      "title": "Live Nasdaq Composite: Markets Target New Highs on Economic Hopes",
      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Apple Stock Bump 11:10 am by Gerelyn Terzo Bank of America analysts have reaffirmed their &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock, pointing to the App Store results as a positive catalyst. Earlier this week, Jefferies analysts lifted their outlook on Apple shares to &#8220;hold&#8221; from &#8220;underperform.&#8221; Apple stock is up 0.78% today but is down 14% year-to-date. Fed in Focus 9:58 am by Gerelyn Terzo With today&#8217;s strong jobs data, indicating a healthy economy, Wall Street analysts are predicting what to expect when Fed policymakers convene next. Here&#8217;s a roundup of some of the commentary: BMO&#8217;s Ian Lyngen remarked, “Overall, it was a strong set of data that implies the Fed will remain on hold later this month, leaving rate cut expectations focused on the September FOMC meeting.” Mutual of America Capital Management CEO Joe Gaffoglio wrote, “The June jobs report continues to demonstrate resilience across the labor market, even as certain sectors such as manufacturing continue to lag. The unemployment rate is holding steady at 4.1%, and real average hourly earnings for employees experienced its largest increase of the year.” Goldman Sachs&#8217; Head of Fixed Income Macro Strategies Simon Dangoor commented: “Today’s stronger jobs report confirms a still resilient U.S. labor market, defying, at least for now, the signs of weakness seen in some leading indicators. The FOMC’s conviction that it should hold its wait-and-see stance while it braces for an acceleration in inflation over the summer will only be strengthened. But we still see a path to a resumption of the Fed’s easing cycle later in the year should the summer acceleration in inflation prove more modest than expected.” This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are celebrating a stronger-than-expected jobs report for June, sending all three of the major stock market indices higher. The economy added 147,000 payrolls last month, far outpacing economist forecasts calling for a slowdown in hiring. Meanwhile, past data was revised upward, while the unemployment rate dropped from 4.2% to 4.1%, once again outshining most expectations. The Nasdaq Composite is on pace for yet another record high, as is the broader S&amp;P 500 market index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.28%. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green today, led by telecom, consumer discretionary and technology. Big Tech is driving much of the gains in the Nasdaq Composite today, including a 2% rise in Meta Technologies (Nasdaq: META) amid an analyst upgrade at Needham, which has assigned a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the stock, up from &#8220;underperform.&#8221; Elon Musk weighed in on X, asking in delight, &#8220;They had a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating on Zuck?&#8221; Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 149.16 (+0.34%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 125.10 (+0.61%) S&amp;P 500: Up 29.48 (+0.48%) Market Movers Datadog (Nasdaq: DDOG), which is behind a cloud-based security platform, is advancing 9.1% today after being chosen as the latest addition to the S&amp;P 500, replacing the outgoing Juniper Networks, which is being acquired by Hewlett Packard (NYSE: HPE). With the index inclusion, DDOG will gain exposure to more institutional and retail portfolios including through ETFs. Synopsys (Nasdaq: SNPS) is gaining 4.4% after the U.S. withdrew U.S. &#8220;chip design software curbs on China,&#8221; per reports. Tripadvisor (Nasdaq: TRIP) is soaring 11.5% today on the heels of an investment by activist investor Starboard, which after taking a 9% position in the stock called the shares undervalued.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)</a>, advising investors to hold the stock. At the time, Apple's share price was <strong>$214.33</strong>. This rating comes amidst a notable development in Apple's performance in China, a key market for the company.</p>\n\n<p>Apple has achieved an <strong>8% year-over-year increase</strong> in iPhone sales in China during the second quarter of 2025. This marks the first quarterly growth in the region since 2023. The growth is largely due to promotional pricing strategies for the iPhone 16 lineup, particularly the Pro and Pro Max models. These strategies were well-timed with the 618 shopping festival, a major discount event in China.</p>\n\n<p>Despite this positive development, Apple's growth in China was outpaced by Huawei, a major competitor, which reported a <strong>12% increase</strong> in sales. This highlights the competitive nature of the Chinese smartphone market. Apple's strategic price adjustments, including increased trade-in values, played a crucial role in boosting sales during this period.</p>\n\n<p>The resurgence in iPhone sales is a significant milestone for Apple as it seeks to solidify its presence in China, one of its most vital markets. The company's market capitalization stands at approximately <strong>$3.2 trillion</strong>, reflecting its substantial influence in the tech industry. As of the latest trading day, Apple's stock price increased by approximately <strong>0.90%</strong> to <strong>$214.36</strong>, with a trading volume of <strong>23.8 million</strong> shares.</p>\n\n<p>Apple's stock has fluctuated between a low of <strong>$211.81</strong> and a high of <strong>$214.64</strong> during the trading day. Over the past year, the stock has reached a high of <strong>$260.10</strong> and a low of <strong>$169.21</strong>. These figures indicate the volatility and potential for growth in Apple's stock, making UBS's Neutral rating a cautious yet reasonable stance for investors.</p>",

According to the report, “iPhone sales grew a healthy 15% YoY in April and May, first two months of Q2 2025. This is Apple’s highest market share for these two months combined post pandemic.” 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone sales have been strong in recent months. Expected price increases due to tariffs are one reason for the increased demand. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has posted sales declines in this period for three years. The reversal of the trend was largely due to the United States and China. “Both US and China returned to positive YoY growth after three years of declines in this less seasonal period,” the authors wrote. There are probably two reasons for the jump. One is that U.S. consumers want to buy an iPhone before tariffs as high as 25% raise prices. The other is that Apple has offered “attractive” prices in China. Counterpoint also noted that iPhone sales in Japan had risen. Demand for the new iPhone 16e, a compact version of the product, triggered the increase. Sales in India have also risen. That market has changed, according to the report: “The iPhone is the most aspirational tech product for tech-savvy consumers here.” The news is particularly good because Samsung, Apple’s greatest global smartphone competition, has introduced new foldable phones. Moreover, Apple has had some success in China, where local companies such as Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo have strong footholds. Apple’s iPhone sales remain constrained because it has not launched the advanced artificial intelligence (AI) product it said would be part of its new iOS. The company says this will not be released until next year. This has disappointed some consumers and affected demand. While consumers worldwide cannot evaluate Apple’s new AI today, it has not undermined sales as much as some experts who follow the company thought it would. Why Is No One Talking About Apple’s Long-Term Artificial Intelligence Plans? The post Recent iPhone Sales Soar appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

      "title": "West Wits secures ZAR 875M facility to launch Qala Shallows development",
      "content": "West Wits Mining Ltd (ASX:WWI, OTCQB:WMWWF) will bank ZAR 875 million (approximately US$50M, AU$76.5M) after signing definitive agreements for a senior syndicated loan facility to fund the Qala Shallows Gold Project in South Africa. This is a significant step in the development of the first phase of the Witwatersrand Basin Project and coincides with the delivery of a 7.5-tonne underground Load-Haul-Dump (LHD) unit to the Qala Shallows site, marking the start of on-the-ground mine development works. The development is expected to generate over 1,000 direct jobs and serve as a catalyst for regional development over the mine’s 18-year life. “The signing of the legal agreements marks a transformative moment for West Wits. Securing this facility is the result of years of focused effort and a strong endorsement of the Qala Shallows Project by top tier South African financial institutions,” West Wits CEO Rudi Deysel said. “Seeing our first LHD unit arrive on site is incredibly exciting. It is a tangible symbol of progress and the beginning of a new chapter as we bring the project to life.” West Wits has executed agreements for a senior syndicated loan facility with the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa and Absa Bank Ltd, through its Corporate and Investment Banking Division. The facility, which will fund approximately 55% of the Qala Shallows development costs, has a 24-month drawdown period and a 36-month repayment term. Interest is linked to the Johannesburg Interbank Average Rate (JIBAR), and 100% of mandatory hedging will be covered by put options, allowing upside exposure to gold prices. The loan will fund development, construction, commissioning and initial operations at Qala Shallows. The remaining 45% of funding will be sourced from equity and early operational revenue. Zwano Nxumalo, project financier at Absa Corporate and Investment Banking, said: “We’re proud to support West Wits on the Qala Shallows Gold Project — a development that will drive local job creation, economic growth, and sustainable mining in the Witwatersrand Basin. This facility reflects our continued commitment to enabling impactful, long-term investments in South Africa’s resources sector.” Following an A$14 million equity raise, West Wits is pressing ahead with mine development activities at Qala, after an increase in ownership of the broader Witwatersrand Basin Project (WBP) to 74%. LHD Unit loaded for delivery to Qala Shallows marking the start of mobilisation as West Wits moves into active development. Key work streams include the buy-back of minority interests in its South African subsidiary, an optimised Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) reflecting stronger gold prices and improved economics, mobilisation for ore extraction at Qala Shallows, and progress on its long-term Project 200 expansion strategy. “It is with great excitement that we kick-off the Qala Shallows Project. The West Wits team undertook extensive preparatory work to ensure that the project will be delivered as a safe, productive and within-budget operation. Service supplier agreements have now been executed with initial orders placed and the first piece of equipment to be delivered this week,” Deysel said. “As West Wits Mining advances to becoming a gold producer, we will continue to focus on ways to realise the potential of the stunning Witwatersrand Basin Project to further grow the business we are starting.” Facility proceeds are strictly applied to Qala Shallows project development. US President Donald Trump has announced the immediate termination of all trade talks with Canada, ending months-long negotiations between the two countries following Canada’s announcement of a new digital services tax (DST). The DST targets large foreign and domestic digital companies, including major US tech firms such as Meta, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. Set to take effect retroactively from 2022, starting on Monday, the DST imposes a 3% tax on large digital companies' revenues from online advertising, social media, online marketplaces, and user data licensing in Canada. Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social that due to this digital services tax, the US will end all trade discussions with Canada effective immediately and plans to inform Canada within the next week about the tariff rates Canada will be required to pay for conducting business with the US. He accused Canada of copying the European Union, which has implemented a similar tax, and described it as “a direct and blatant attack on our country.” “Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven day period.” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s office did not immediately comment on Trump’s remarks.",

      "title": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Predicts AI’s ‘Make or Break’ Moment is Almost Here",
      "content": "Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) researchers recently released a paper named &#8216;Illusions of Thinking&#8216; that casts new doubts on the capabilities of &#8216;reasoning&#8217; models that are seeing tens of billions of dollars of research and development in the AI space. In the segment below, 24/7 Wall St. Analyst Eric Bleeker breaks down the implications of Apple&#8217;s newest paper. Bleeker says that investors will want to key in on whether AI can make &#8216;novel discoveries&#8217; in 2026. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has predicted that leading AI models will begin making these discoveries in 2026. If that happens, AI spending will continue to race full speed ahead. If 2026 passes without novel discoveries, then Apple&#8217;s criticisms of reasoning models will look more compelling. Key Points Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is taking a contrarian stance in the AI space, downplaying reasoning model capabilities in a recent research paper and showing reduced AI emphasis at WWDC, contrasting sharply with peers&#8217; aggressive AI investments. While OpenAI, backed by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), is pushing toward novel AI discoveries by 2026 with infrastructure like Stargate, Apple appears culturally and strategically hesitant to embrace foundational AI advancements. Despite skepticism from Apple’s research, usage data and capabilities like DeepMind&#8217;s AlphaFold show current AI can already dramatically accelerate scientific discovery, offering substantial near-term economic value.

Instead its relying on partnerships with companies like OpenAI. At 24/7 Wall St., we believe the release of reasoning models &#8211; roughly corresponding to the release of o3 in December last year … Is the next step-change in AI model capabilities. However, a recent paper from Apple researchers casts doubt on the overall capabilities of reasoning models. The paper &#8211; named &#8216;Illusions of Thinking&#8217; &#8211; detailed how reasoning models solve a series of puzzles. The paper&#8217;s findings were essentially that reasoning models capabilities are more limited than believed &#8211; they&#8217;re just advanced pattern matching. Our take: we don’t find the paper especially compelling. We won’t get into too many details, but AI researchers we follow have poked some pretty sizable holes into how the study was conducted and its overall conclusions. Here&#8217;s what we think is important to watch if you&#8217;re concerend about Apple&#8217;s recent paper. One of the biggest criticisms of AI has been: Where are the novel discoveries? That is to say, while AI has contributed to some major discoveries like protein-folding, there have been no major discoveries directly made by leading AI models. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, recently published a blog that’s worth reading. It&#8217;s named &#8216;The Gentle Singularity.&#8217; In it, he lays out a timeline we can come back to and hold him accountable to. 2025: Rise of Agents 2026: Novel insights from AI 2027: Robots that can do tasks in the real world So, essentially he’s dropping the gauntlet that GPT5 will be powerful enough for these novel discoveries… If that’s the case, the upside for AI essentially becomes infinite; it is the driver for economic progress for the remainder of our lives. If it’s wrong… Total spend on AI is likely too high at current rates. The AI Investor Podcast Is Your Source What Could Become Technology&#8217;s Biggest Trend Ever This discussion comes from 24/7 Wall St.&#8217;s AI Investor Podcast. The podcast covers the biggest developments in AI and how you can build a portfolio filled with the highest-upside stocks in the space. You can listen to our most recent episode on YouTube or leading podcast apps like Apple Podcasts or Spotify. Transcript: [00:00:05] Austin Smith: And now, you know, a, a counterpoint to that is I wanna talk about this Apple Illusions of thinking paper, because Apple is one of the largest tech companies that, you know what I mean? Like, like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Microsoft was really hot on AI. But in their most recent, uh, worldwide developer conference, there was way less AI, way less Apple intelligence than in the prior release. [00:00:24] Austin Smith: So on one hand, we&#8217;re seeing Apple sort of standalone here, and some of the, the steam is coming out of their own AI enthusiasm and they&#8217;re releasing this illusions of thinking paper that sort of puts a little bit of cold water on the AI narrative. So, but, but everything else we&#8217;re seeing is an increase in demand and compute and inference from everybody else in Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and Microsoft and Google. [00:00:45] Austin Smith: So. What is going on with Apple? Are they, you know, is this a cultural change? Is this, is this something? Are they seeing something other people don&#8217;t? Why does Apple sort of stand alone here in this super major AI space? [00:00:58] Eric Bleeker: Yeah. Apple&#8217;s such an interesting company, right? Because everyone else is spending tens of billions of dollars on CapEx and they&#8217;ve kind of not played that game. [00:01:07] Eric Bleeker: They can do that in part because they have unique distribution right at the start of smartphones. You have said their greatest weakness is. Something like search all these Google services, they, they don&#8217;t control that and they&#8217;re beholding, but the end outcome was they end up charging Google 20 or $30 billion per year in pure profits to become the default search engine. [00:01:29] Eric Bleeker: So them being that initial point of distribution as the operating system for all consumer devices allows them to play a little bit of a different game. But it&#8217;s also kind of in their best interests. To kind of talk down some of the areas that they&#8217;re not competing in, which is a bit what this paper did. [00:01:50] Eric Bleeker: It comes from, um, apple researchers and basically we&#8217;ve talked about along this show, our belief is that in December of last year, the birth of new powerful reasoning models, which really began when oh three was released on December 20th, was the next step change in AI demand. And what Apple&#8217;s researchers came out and said is that they believe that these reasoning models that are coming out through a series of puzzles that they tried having them solve, that they put in the paper, basically had just a lot less capability than people believed. [00:02:28] Eric Bleeker: Essentially. They&#8217;re just much better at pattern matching, uh, than people give them credit for. So this Austin, this got a lot of attention, right? Because it&#8217;s potentially saying it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s another. A potential piece of evidence that we&#8217;re in a bubble, that AI is just going to hit a wall, where when you ask it to take that next step, the next step being discovering novel discoveries. [00:02:55] Eric Bleeker: Mm-hmm. You know, asking AI to start doing things like finding cures for diseases. It&#8217;s not going to be able to make that jump. And if that is the case, that would be tremendously bad for that future of outlook and all the spending that&#8217;s happening right now. Right. So my take on this, and again, I am not an AI researcher. [00:03:16] Eric Bleeker: My main job is to basically find who I believe are the smartest minds and, and people that have great track records on this. I. And evaluate who I think is the most accurate. And, and I don&#8217;t find the paper especially compelling. I, I won&#8217;t get into too many details, but a lot of people have poked some pretty sizable holes into how this study was conducted. [00:03:39] Eric Bleeker: But I, I do wanna point out Austin, you know, of the other big storylines that&#8217;s, you know, maybe on the fringes that if, if you&#8217;re investing in ai you don&#8217;t see, was Sam Altman, who&#8217;s the CEO of Open AI. He released a blog this year, uh, or. This week, I should say, um, just about his thoughts on AI. It, it&#8217;s named the gentle Singularity. [00:04:01] Eric Bleeker: You could search that, you could search his blog and you could find it, but in layman&#8217;s terms, he&#8217;s, he&#8217;s making a lot of predictions you can hold him accountable to and in his belief. 2025. The story is the rise of agents. That&#8217;s something we agree with. We&#8217;ve been saying since last year, you know, mid last year, we&#8217;ve always said we believe the narrative this year, especially in the back half, would be the rise of agents. [00:04:27] Eric Bleeker: He believes 2026 is going to be the birth of novel insights from AI, and 2027 is robotics that can change the real world. So you know this, this lines up Austin, right? With a lot of storylines we&#8217;re talking about. But he is essentially dropping the gauntlet that, as I mentioned earlier, OpenAI is waiting for Stargate to become operational, uh, to basically train their next version, uh, GPT five, to have the capability to do that. [00:04:59] Eric Bleeker: And once that&#8217;s happened, he believes those novel discoveries will start becoming a storyline next year. So that becomes one of the things that we will be actively tracking on this podcast that. If you start seeing novel discoveries from AI, we are on pace. And frankly, if AI starts making meaningful novel discoveries, that is the strongest validation yet that it becomes the main economic driver for the rest of our lives. [00:05:30] Eric Bleeker: Mm-hmm. And if that is the case and, and you&#8217;re not actively investing in this, good luck to you because that, that will be a little bit of a rubber meets the road moment. We&#8217;re gonna be watching out for. [00:05:42] Austin Smith: Right. And you know, to, to anybody who&#8217;s listening to that and saying, oh, well maybe I&#8217;ll wait until AI has proven in the, the novel discovery framework before I become an investor. [00:05:51] Austin Smith: I think that would be a mistake as well, because that&#8217;s not to say that the current versions of AI and LLMs don&#8217;t have incredible economic forces and tailwinds behind them. You talked about medicine discovery, uh, famously alpha fold, you know, detected protein foldings and predicted 3D structures of proteins, which is a very complicated, uh, thing to do. [00:06:10] Austin Smith: And it didn&#8217;t necessarily uncover new breakthroughs per se, but it completely supercharged the discovery of these, uh, folding structures that would&#8217;ve been discovered just over a much longer timeframe. So it pulled forward all of those discoveries faster. Now, that might not necessarily have been novel. [00:06:26] Austin Smith: It was applying techniques that, as I understand it, certainly not an AI researcher, but was applying techniques that. We already had and knew, but just completely supercharged them and allowed us to make discoveries earlier. You know, when I read the, the, or tried to read, I should say, the illusions of Thinking paper by Apple, it, it sounded a little bit to me like a case. [00:06:45] Austin Smith: Maybe it&#8217;s just a case of someone coming from sour grapes a little bit like I. You know, Apple&#8217;s always been a bit of a taste maker company and designing the thing you, you didn&#8217;t know you needed and then you can&#8217;t live without. And they&#8217;ve been uniquely good at that, perhaps the best of all time. Um, but technologically speaking, a reasoning model just gives up a lot of that to, to the model. [00:07:02] Austin Smith: And it might be just culturally antithetical to, to what Apple is built on as a company. So, you know, I&#8217;m, I you gotta pay attention to everything that happens in this space. Apple&#8217;s incredibly gifted at what they do. Um, but this, this didn&#8217;t change my thinking about the potential of, of what we&#8217;re seeing. [00:07:17] Eric Bleeker: And I do wanna double click on one point you made there that you know, you can always say, I will just wait for this. Next, threat or overhang to resolve before I invest. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to go through the cycles that as new trends happen that you&#8217;re able to see in real time. [00:07:35] Eric Bleeker: There is always something new that says, there&#8217;s a reason I shouldn&#8217;t invest in this today. So if you&#8217;re waiting for one threat to go. There will be another. Nothing is an absolute slam dunk. Last week, Austin, we talked about the best time on a risk adjusted basis to buy Apple was six years after mobile started. [00:07:52] Eric Bleeker: Mm-hmm. Um, the trough of disillusionment for the internet itself came eight years after it started. There&#8217;s always going to be some new threat that, you know, unless you followed one of these cycles, to truly appreciate that you&#8217;re never going to make money investing in a perfectly rosy picture. It&#8217;s just really hard to understand that that&#8217;s part of why we wanted to start this podcast was to give that record of investing throughout the a i Age. [00:08:22] Eric Bleeker: &#8217;cause at some point in retrospect, it&#8217;ll be, I believe it&#8217;ll be of course. Why didn&#8217;t you invest in that AI was obvious, right? And it&#8217;s not obvious. And we&#8217;ve broken down all the areas where we had to be incredibly. Counter to the dominant narratives, you know, you&#8217;ll be able to go back around When we did our deep seek episodes, where we called it before it happened, where we broke it down after, and we have been knocking down a lot of these, you know, bear cases. [00:08:53] Eric Bleeker: It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not because we are blind cheerleaders for AI. Far from it, you know, we are people who want to make money and the only thing that makes you money in the long run is what happens in reality. But you know, again, we, we have believed that this story&#8217;s happening and, and we have gone through many of these threats in the front half of the year to have a show today that is. [00:09:19] Eric Bleeker: Largely just focused on acceleration and bullishness, which couldn&#8217;t be any different from what we were seeing five, six months ago.​ The post OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Predicts AI&#8217;s &#8216;Make or Break&#8217; Moment is Almost Here appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",
