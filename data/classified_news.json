      "title": "5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens on Wednesday",
      "content": "Close U.S. stock futures are pointing lower as investors ready for today's tariffs announcement expected from President Donald Trump after markets close; Tesla (TSLA) is slated to report first-quarter deliveries amid a downturn for its stock; Visa (V) reportedly is offering a payment of roughly $100 million to get Apple's (AAPL) credit card payment network business; and USDC stablecoin issuer Circle files for an IPO. Here's what investors need to know today. 1. US Stock Futures Dip as Investors Await Tariffs Updates U.S. stock futures are pointing lower following a volatile trading session as investors await White House tariff plans expected to be announced later today. Market watchers are also following today's private sector payrolls release ahead of Friday's job report. Nasdaq futures are 0.8% lower after the tech-focused index gained 0.9% Tuesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 futures are lower by about 0.5%. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is down slightly at around $85,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is down below 4.15%. Oil futures are down. Gold futures are slightly higher. 2. Investors Brace for Trump Tariffs Announcement After Markets Close President Donald Trump is set to unveil his latest tariffs proposal at a White House event slated to start at the close of markets at 4 p.m. ET. Trump's advisers continue to hash out the details surrounding the new tariffs he plans to implement ahead of the \"Liberation Day\" event, Bloomberg reported. While Trump has said he was seeking reciprocal tariffs to match import taxes on U.S.-made products, a report in The Washington Post indicated that advisers were also mulling a 20% tariff on nearly all imported products. 3. Tesla Stock Slips Ahead of Quarterly Deliveries Data Tesla (TSLA) shares are down 2.5% in premarket trading ahead of the electric vehicle maker's expected release of its first-quarter deliveries data this morning. Analysts expect Tesla to report 393,000 deliveries, up less than 2% year-over-year but fewer than last quarter's 495,570 vehicles. The data comes as analysts have raised concerns that CEO Elon Musk's work with the Trump administration is creating distractions and impacting Tesla's business. Tesla shares have shed one-third of their value in 2025. 4. Visa Offers Apple $100M to Take Over Credit Card Network, Report Says Visa (V) is offering a payment of roughly $100 million to get Apple's (AAPL) credit card network business, according to The Wall Street Journal. The report said that Apple would select a payment provider before selecting a bank to take over its credit card from Goldman Sachs (GS), and that Visa is competing with Mastercard (MA)—which is \"fiercely trying to keep its role as the network on this card\"—and American Express (AXP). The Journal previously reported that JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Synchrony Financial (SYF), Capital One (COF) and American Express were in the running to take over as the issuer of the credit card. 5. USDC Stablecoin Issuer Circle Files for IPO Circle, the company behind the dollar-backed USDC stablecoin, has filed for a U.S. initial public offering (IPO). In its prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Circle said it plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under ticker symbol \"CRCL.\" Circle, which had previously announced plans to go public in 2021 via a SPAC merger, said its 2024 net income was $155.7 million, down from $267.6 million a year earlier.

      "content": "Vanguard has some of the best ETFs that are known for their low expense ratios. Lower costs allow you to keep more of the profits that your ETFs generate. Vanguard offers close to 100 ETFs that give investors access to major benchmarks, popular investment strategies, and sectors. Buying Vanguard ETFs during dips can lead to meaningful profits in the long run, especially if you can hold onto your shares for many years. Another great thing about their ETFs is that you don&#8217;t have to know much about the stock market to generate positive returns. A fund manager oversees the positions to ensure they align with the ETF&#8217;s stated goals. Investors who are looking for bargains and the potential for promising long-term returns may want to consider these three Vanguard ETFs. Key Points Vanguard has some of the best ETFs with low expense ratios. Discover some of the top Vanguard ETFs to buy that can increase your wealth. Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF (VUG) The Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:VUG) has historically been an outperformer. It&#8217;s up by more than 170% over the past five years while the S&amp;P 500 has rallied by 145% during the same stretch. Despite the long-term gains, VUG looks promising due to its recent dip. The ETF is in the middle of a correction and has shed approximately 8% of its value year-to-date. VUG has 180 holdings and prioritizes large-cap stocks like the Magnificent Seven. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are the top three holdings, and they make up more than one-third of the fund&#8217;s total assets. VUG is a tech-heavy ETF. More than half of its capital is in the sector, and this high allocation is a common theme among ETFs that outperform the stock market. Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU) Not every investor wants to deal with high market volatility, especially as they get closer to retirement. The Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEARCA:VPU) can give investors positive returns without the dramatic price movements of growth stocks in the tech sector. The fund has delivered respectable returns as well. It&#8217;s up by 24% over the past year and has delivered a 64% gain over the past five years. The fund has a reasonable 0.09% expense ratio and places a strong emphasis on electric utilities. A focus on utility stocks has resulted in a lofty 30-day SEC yield of 2.85%. You can earn solid cash flow from this ETF while growing your money. Utilities are essential, and they are one of the last expenses consumers and businesses will cut. The fund also has a 20.2 P/E ratio which trails the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s 28.2 P/E ratio. Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO) The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) tracks the S&amp;P 500 and looks more attractive after a correction. The fund gives investors exposure to tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia while they are still recovering from corrections. A market rally can send these stocks soaring and reward VOO investors. However, the S&amp;P 500 isn&#8217;t just about tech stocks. Almost 70% of its total capital is allocated to sectors outside of tech. This diversification results in less volatility than the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. VOO has a 0.03% expense ratio and a 1.21% 30-day SEC yield. Unsurprisingly, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia are the top three positions. However, they only make up about 19% of the fund&#8217;s total assets. That&#8217;s less concentration than VUG. VOO is still down year-to-date, but its 146% rally over the past five years indicates the types of returns this fund can get when the stock market rebounds.

      "content": "Apple has been hit with a €150 million ($162 million) fine by France’s competition authority over its App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, a move that adds pressure from multiple fronts as investigations in other EU countries gain traction. The penalty, announced on Monday, stems from how the iPhone maker rolled out the ATT feature, which critics argue undermines competition by limiting third-party advertising while boosting Apple’s own ad services.The fine reflects growing concern in the European Union about how dominant tech companies enforce privacy standards that may also act as commercial barriers. In Apple’s case, regulators found that ATT, introduced in 2021, unfairly impacted rival app developers and publishers by making user consent harder for third parties to obtain.ATT rollout triggers EU probesFrench regulators said Apple’s ATT rollout was neither necessary nor proportionate to the company’s stated goal of protecting user privacy. Although the tool asks users whether they want apps to track their activity across other apps and websites, the French Competition Authority found that the system was designed in a way that placed a heavier burden on third-party developers than on Apple itself.One major issue was the number of consent pop-ups users encountered. While third-party apps were required to display the ATT prompt, Apple’s own advertising services were integrated in a way that required less user effort to accept. Users had to opt out of ad tracking twice in Apple’s own settings, which the French watchdog said undermined the feature’s neutrality.Apple has also been ordered to publish the decision on its website for seven days, a standard measure in France for competition-related rulings.The French investigation originated from industry complaints filed in 2021. While emergency action was denied at the time, the regulator pursued a full-scale probe that has now led to financial penalties.Smaller publishers lose ad revenueIn its ruling, France’s authority emphasised the disproportionate economic impact ATT had on smaller app developers and ad service providers. These smaller players typically rely on third-party data collection for revenue generation through targeted advertising. Apple’s changes disrupted these practices, cutting off access to Apple&#8217;s Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) if users declined consent via the ATT prompt.This restriction effectively altered the dynamics of the mobile advertising market, where Apple&#8217;s rivals found themselves operating under stricter conditions. Apple, on the other hand, retained certain capabilities for its own ads within the App Store and other services.The competition body argued that ATT&#8217;s dual opt-out process placed unnecessary hurdles in front of users and made it more likely that they would remain in Apple&#8217;s ecosystem, giving the company an edge in the mobile ad space.Investigations spread to 4 countriesThe fine is part of broader scrutiny in Europe. Competition authorities in Germany, Italy, Romania, and Poland have each launched similar investigations into ATT, reflecting concerns that Apple may be favouring its own services in ways that violate local and EU-wide competition laws.These investigations focus not only on ATT’s technical implementation but also on the market power Apple holds through its control of iOS, the App Store, and user access to device-level data.While the French authority acted independently, any eventual findings from these additional countries could fuel coordinated EU action or raise the possibility of further fines and regulatory measures.Apple’s privacy tool under fireApple introduced ATT in April 2021 as part of iOS 14.5, presenting it as a privacy-focused feature aimed at giving users control over how apps track their online behaviour. The move was widely welcomed by privacy advocates, but triggered immediate backlash from advertisers and app developers.Since the rollout, Apple’s ad business has grown significantly, driven in part by increased reliance on the App Store’s native ad network. Critics argue that Apple’s design choices favour its own ecosystem while making it harder for competitors to maintain viable advertising models.Although the ATT framework technically applies to all apps, the French Competition Authority said Apple was not held to the same standard as others when it came to gaining user consent, thus violating the principle of fair access and harming competition.The post France fines Apple €150 million over app tracking violations, EU probes follow appeared first on Invezz",

      "title": "Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Price Prediction and Forecast (March 2025)",
      "content": "Due to efforts to bolster U.S. domestic chip production and reduce reliance on overseas supply chains, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM), AKA TSMC, plans to drastically increase its investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, including new fabrication plants and advanced packaging facilities in Arizona. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) holds a crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain, commanding over 60% of global spending at chip foundries. Its ability to deliver cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities is essential for customers developing artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing, and other advanced technologies. Therefore, we see a more than 46% gain for the stock by the end of the decade. If you’re looking for some stocks with huge potential, make sure to grab a free copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. It features a software stock we’re confident has 10X potential. The stock hit an all-time high of $226.40 earlier this year but has been in retreat since then. In fact, the share price is 8.3% lower than at the start of the year. It is up 28.9% year over year, though, outperforming the broader markets in that time. Wall Street remains optimistic, and analysts see plenty of room for the stock to run, at least in the short term. Investors are of course concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. Although most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it is clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term prognostications irrelevant. 24/7 Wall St. aims to present some farther-looking insights based on TSMC’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help with your own research. All Roads Lead to Taiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor has control of roughly 62% of the global chip market. In the high-tech universe, there is a single common road that top-flight companies like Nvidia, AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and many others must travel to get their chips made, no matter where they hail from. That road inevitably leads to TSMC, the largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. When a company like Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) designs a new chip, it takes it to TSMC to actually print the design on a silicon wafer. TSMC is the top choice for Nvidia, AMD, and many other chip designers, thanks to its precision, quality control, and innovative technical capabilities. At the time of this writing, TSMC commands over 60% of global spending at chip foundries. The explosion of growth in the artificial intelligence and data center arenas have led to a commensurate demand acceleration for graphics processing unit (GPU) chips and a panoply of similar ones for those fields. By focusing on precision foundry work, TSMC has become the premier “go-to” player, for chip designers, even among those competing in various sectors. TSMC does face certain challenges, including: Despite its crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain, Taiwan Semiconductor is based in Taiwan. The Leadership of the People’s Republic of China claims that Taiwan is a part of China proper. Any overt military action on Taiwanese soil likely would result in a domino-effect of chip shortages. TSMC had raised prices for its 3-nanometer and 5-nm process products by up to 8%. However, Samsung is focusing on its 2-nm process to meet future technologies’ high-performance, low-power, and high-bandwidth requirements, and rival Intel has a 1.4-nm ultra-fine process slated to be unveiled in 2027. The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical. While AI investment soars, TSMC has few rivals of significance. During slow periods, semiconductor companies have often been glutted with excess inventory. It remains to be seen how TSMC will handle a slowdown after ramping up production to such a high level. TSMC&#8217;s Performance The company experienced significant growth and transformation from 2014 to 2024, in that time solidifying its position as a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing. 2014 was the year that the TSMC-Apple cooperation began in earnest, with Apple’s A8 and A8X SoCss. Such has the cooperation expanded that Apple has gone to TSMC for nearly 100% of its chip requirements by 2024. Opposing patent infringement lawsuits with GlobalFoundries in 2019 eventually settled with a cross-licensing agreement, which ends in 2029. 2020 saw TSMC prudently decide to diversify its manufacturing by opening up new plants in Phoenix, Arizona, and Dresden, Germany. In July 2020, TSMC signed a 20-year deal with Ørsted to buy the entire production of two offshore wind farms under development off Taiwan&#8217;s west coast. At the time of its signing, it was the world&#8217;s largest corporate green energy order ever made. 2021 saw TSMC form joint ventures with Sony and Denso in Japan.

The surge in artificial intelligence (AI) is a primary driver for TSMC, but its future growth is also heavily tied to strategic partnerships, geopolitical considerations, and the following: Technological Leadership: TSMC&#8217;s ongoing advancement in process technology, particularly in nodes like 3nm and beyond, allows them to command premium pricing and maintain a strong market share. The company&#8217;s ability to deliver cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities is essential for customers developing advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing, and advanced mobile devices. Demand from Key Sectors: The increasing demand for semiconductors in crucial fields like AI, high-performance computing (HPC), and 5G and advanced mobile devices. While the surge in AI applications drives a need for the powerful chips TSMC manufactures, data centers and other HPC applications also require high-end semiconductors. Furthermore, the evolution of 5G and the increasing sophistication of mobile devices contribute significantly to TSMC&#8217;s revenue. Supply Chain Dynamics: The importance of robust semiconductor supply chains is undeniable, and TSMC&#8217;s role in that chain is very crucial. This serves as an incentive for the international community to keep Taiwan out of Beijing’s control. Because of its uniquely advanced manufacturing capabilities, TSMC can easily scale for demand acceleration, and it holds close to a near monopoly on large graphics processing unit (GPU) chip contracts from major semiconductor designers for AI and data center use. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 TSMC’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips that can mimic many human brain functions. The consensus recommendation for TSMC stock from 17 Wall Street analysts is to buy shares. Three of those analysts have Strong Buy ratings. Their average price target in 12 months is $247.07, which is 37.5% above the current price. 24/7 Wall St.’s 12-month projection for TSMC’s price is $183.92 a share, which signals a gain of 2.4% in the coming year. While the company is set to start its 2-nm process this year, Samsung has a vested interest in developing its own niche advantage and support from the Korean government in that space. As a result, we do not anticipate as big of a 2025 surge from 2-nm as other analysts might. Outlook for the Next 5 Years Since TSMC consumes as much as 5% of Taiwan’s entire energy output, its Ørsted wind farm energy production should manifest tangible cost savings benefits. Therefore, we project 2026’s stock price to hit $186.00, a 5.8% year-over-year retreat. While its 2-nm process will likely compete favorably at the start against Samsung, the TSMC competitive advantage in other avenues of chip manufacturing will ultimately prove to be overwhelming. The anticipated surge of data center spending on chips should fuel larger contracts. Collaborations with research institutions and tech giants in developing next-generation AI chips could open new revenue streams and strengthen its position as an innovation leader in the industry. Our projection for 2027 is $206.80. 2028 should begin to see the rewards from the 2024 R&amp;D surge of $32 billion in advanced process technologies. New products from TSM investments in quantum computing research are expected to bear fruit by 2028, potentially revolutionizing certain computing applications. The company’s focus on developing ultra-low power consumption chips for IoT and edge computing devices could position it as a key player in the growing market for energy-efficient technologies. The 2028 24/7 Wall St. price target is $213.90. 2029 will mark the expiration of TSMC’s GlobalFoundries cross-licensing agreement, which should double up the revenues from that stream. Further developments in chips for quantum computing, healthcare, and other applications can open up more direct government contract opportunities. U.S. and German TSMC factories should be operating at full capacity by 2029. We anticipate a price jump to $245.99. By 2030, TSMC&#8217;s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips at the forefront of AI applications. These would mimic human brain functions more closely than ever before. The company’s involvement in space exploration projects and renewable energy initiatives may also diversify its revenue streams and enhance its global technological influence. We expect a $254.59 stock price, representing a more than 46% gain over today&#8217;s stock price.

      "title": "Live Nasdaq Composite: AMZN (Nasdaq: AMZN), CEG (Nasdaq: CEG) Fall in Sea of Red",
      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Markets Lose Their Mojo 4:00 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets finished the day much like they started it &#8211; lower. All three of the major stock market indexes were sent reeling today, including an eye-popping 4% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. Right behind it was the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with nearly another 1,000-point drop, and the S&amp;P 500, falling 3.3%. President Trump is willing to extend the 90-day tariff relief, but it did little to lift the market sentiment today. Meanwhile, the trade war with China is only becoming more intense, with Fox Business reporting that President Trump is looking to delist China-listed companies from the U.S. stock market. Here&#8217;s a look at today&#8217;s damage: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 964.73 (-2.38%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 698.15 (-4.08%) S&amp;P 500: Down 181.50 (-3.3%) Tariff Fears Return 1:36 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The Nasdaq Composite&#8217;s 5.8% drop is being fueled by declines in Big Tech, including Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), which are each down between 4% and 7% today. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 is barreling toward circuit breaker status in which trading on the NYSE is halted to prevent further panic selling. President Trump is speaking with Cabinet members today on Capitol Hill while a U.S./China trade war fuels selling. Every sector of the economy is showing red today, including a 6.7% drop in energy stocks. Apple Falls 6% 11:52 am by Gerelyn Terzo Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock is falling by over 6% in today&#8217;s trading action. The declines come on the heels of the day in which it experienced its best trading day in nearly three decades. The broader market selling has intensified, sending the Nasdaq Composite spiraling by about 5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower by 3.4% and the S&amp;P 500 lower by 4.2%, erasing much of yesterday&#8217;s gains. Tariffs are easing while inflation is falling, but stocks are still spooked. Roller Coaster Ride 10:06 am by Gerelyn Terzo Stocks remain under pressure as of mid-morning trading, including a 3.2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite after yesterday&#8217;s historic performance. The easing tariffs have failed to lift market sentiment today. Used-car platform CarMax (NYSE: KMX) is falling 14% after a disappointing fiscal Q4 earnings print. Taiwan Semi (TSMC) is falling by 3%. Trump Media (Nasdaq: DJT) is falling 1%. U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) is falling by 7.3%. The markets opened in a sea of red on the heels of yesterday&#8217;s historic rally. Today these skittish markets are taking back some of those gains after investors followed President Trump&#8217;s advice to buy the dip. Despite tariff relief, all three of the major stock market averages went south, with Big Tech names dragging the Nasdaq Composite lower. Most sectors of the economy were under pressure in early trading, including declines of over 3% each in energy and tech. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) is down 3% this morning. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on CNBC that the current market environment could be a tailwind for acquisitions. He also believes sellers on the e-commerce platform would pass along tariff costs to consumers. The company continues to invest heavily in AI. The markets has the opportunity to shift their attention from tariffs to inflation this morning. In a dose of good news, the Labor Department&#8217;s latest inflation print came in cooler than expected, with consumer prices easing to 2.4% in the 12-month stretch leading up to March, compared with economists expectations of 2.6%. On a monthly basis, the CPI declined by 0.1% last month after climbing higher by 0.2% in February, a welcome shift. Historically, March inflation generally increases, with this year marking a notable shift in the trend. Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 706.27 (-1.74%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 478.08 (-2.7%) S&amp;P 500: Down 117.81 (-2.16%) Market Movers Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stock is off 5% today. The company has begun selling its EVs in Saudi Arabia where it is hoping to drive a social shift in the oil-rich Kingdom that is dependent on fossil-fueled powered vehicles. Cognizant Technology Solutions (Nasdaq: CTSH) is falling by 3% today after inking a partnership deal with OMRON&#8217;s automation business products. With a market cap of $34.8 billion, CTSH pays a dividend yield of 1.8%. Energy stocks are also under pressure, including Constellation Energy (Nasdaq: CEG), which is falling by 3.5% today. The stock is up over 10% in the past five days and is experiencing profit taking today though it remains above the $200 threshold.

      "title": "Donald Trump Campaigned on Cutting Corporate Taxes – Where Does That Promise Stand Today?",
      "content": "President Donald J. Trump’s 2024 electoral campaign was buoyed by the hope that his leadership would return the economic prosperity of his previous term, which had been decimated by Bidenomics and rampant Congressional spending, fueling inflation to the worst levels in 40 years. Central to President Trump’s strong economic performance from 2016-2020 was the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. TCHA resulted in unprecedented business growth, new entrepreneurism, historically low unemployment among all ethnic groups, and consumer confidence soaring to an 18-year high. The 21% corporate rate is one of the few permanent aspects to TCJA not subject to expiration. President Trump has been adamant about the need to renew TCJA, as other key provisions expire in December, 2025. He is also proposing additional tax cuts, such as taxes on overtime, tips, Social Security payments, and has even proposed eliminating federal income tax altogether, to be replaced with revenues from a national consumption tax and tariffs. However, analysts have debated the merits of further tax cuts, the impact on the national debt, and whether or not Congress would ultimately be able to legislate these proposals into law. Key Points The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) delivered unprecedented business growth and entrepreneurism, in addition to additional retained money in the pockets of a majority of American citizens. President Trump campaigned on cutting taxes further on a number of fronts, including renewal of TCJA before its expiration in December, 2025. Many analysts who have debated over the effectiveness of further tax cuts fail to include the massive regulatory cuts, the large pending reductions in wasteful spending being identified by DOGE, and the resultant job creation, business growth, and fresh investment into US business as a result of the tariff policies.

Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Arguments Against Tax Cuts and The Truth Senator Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is one of the main opponents to tax cuts and reduced spending that take away power from Democrats&#8217; pet projects. Not surprisingly, the entirety of elected Democrats, as well as left-leaning Republicans, have been the loudest voices against cutting taxes. Democrat leaders like Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have been among the more articulate critics, although their mantras about “tax cuts would only be for the top 1%” and that “the rich don’t pay their fair share” have been thoroughly debunked by genuine statistics and even left leaning Factcheck.org. In actuality, TCJA benefited over 75% of all US taxpayers, and it has been verified that the top 1%, in fact, pay 40% of the entirety of federal income tax. The Congressional Budget Office’s analysis projects that a TCJA extension would create increased deficits based on reduced tax revenues from present levels. It forecasts a $4.6 trillion shortfall over 10 years, accounting for interest on outstanding federal debt. The Tax Policy Center projected that economic growth would offset only 6% of the shortfall. One crucial point is that neither the CBO or TPC prognostications take into account any significant spending cuts nor how tariffs will accelerate cutting deficits, as well as other key policy ramifications already in effect in the Trump Administration: How tariffs are creating fresh US investment, new businesses, and more crucial private sector jobs. The impact of lower tax rates and the elimination of onerous Biden-imposed regulatory burdens are jump-starting new manufacturing and other major business creation. How ending potential trillions in fraudulent, misappropriated, and likely criminal spending waste from USAID and numerous other federal agencies uncovered by DOGE will accelerate the goal towards eliminating the trillions in federal debt overhang via drastically reduced spending. Why a national consumption tax effectively rebuts Democrat opponents’ claims of “unfairness” and “only favoring the rich”. Trump Fiscal Policy Results In The First 60+ Days Cutting the trillions of wasteful and criminal spending of taxpayer dollars uncovered by Elon Musk and DOGE could accelerate President Trump&#8217;s plans to fix the US economy and restore manufacturing and other critical businesses. Since taking office in January, the threat of Trump&#8217;s tariffs has already created a seismic shift in the corporate business environment. For example: In response to prospective 25% tariffs on products made in Taiwan, Taiwan Semiconductor, the maker of all of the GPUs from Nvidia and AMD required to run Artificial Intelligence, announced a $100 billion investment into new factories to be located in AZ for making GPUs and other semiconductor products expressly for the US market. SoftBank Group Corp. from Japan pledged to invest $50 billion in the US to create 50,000 new jobs. Apple announced it invested $500 billion for AI servers to be built in Michigan and Texas, creating 20,000 new jobs. Oracle, ChatGPT, and OpenAI announced its Stargate JV would invest up to $500 billion for AI infrastructure construction, creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs in various states, commencing with Texas. The revival of US-manufactured steel and copper is already underway, thanks to US tariffs to prevent dumping from China and other nations into the US market. Additionally, Elon Musk’s DOGE has been uncovering misappropriated taxpayer funds, payments to nonexistent recipients, and useless pork projects ostensibly designed to serve as political kickbacks and bribes to overseas entities, all of which are in the process of being cut. The anticipated spending cuts, something not factored into the CBO calculations, could drastically accelerate the rate of reducing the federal debt. A recent CBS poll found that 77% of the American public supports the work of DOGE. Lastly, a consumption tax, proposed as a 14-17% tax on all new goods except for food and medicine, would be a tax that visibly and unequivocally hits the wealthiest the hardest, thus debunking any accusations about unfairness. With no loopholes, a flat consumption tax is based on the value of the purchased item. Since expensive goods that are only affordable for the wealthy have a higher price tag, the commensurate tax revenues from those items will generate more tax revenues. President Trump was given a mandate by the electorate. While he has already enacted some of his plans to good effect, his tax and regulatory cutting proposals will still require much combating with Democrats, the predominant recipients of high taxes and big government spending. Over the next 4 years, the results of these battles will determine the extent of the initiatives’ full financial benefits.

      "content": "A day following &#8220;Liberation Day,&#8221; the talk of the town is that investors have been liberated from capital gains taxes. The Dow Jones is down 3.72%, the Nasdaq is down more than 5%, and the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO) is down 3.93% as of 10:25 a.m. ET. Why is the market selling off? Tariffs announced by the Trump Administration are estimated to reduce trade by $900 billion this year. Almost every Wall Street bank is now pulling back economic growth estimates for the year. Tariff rates on other countries announced last night range from 10% to more than 50%. As of 2022, the United States had a weighted-average tariff rate of about 1.5%. However, after Trump&#8217;s tariff announcement yesterday the United States would have a weighted average tariff rate of 29%. Another issue driving stocks down today is the fact these tariffs appear to be less of a &#8216;negotiating tactic&#8217; and something that will be in place for a prolonged period of time. For example, both Vietnam and Israel announced large cuts to tariffs on U.S. goods, but saw reciprocal tariff rates of 46% and 17%, respectively. What Stocks Are Falling in the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF? What stocks in the VOO are seeing the biggest declines today? Retailers and Clothing: Williams-Sonoma is down 18.1%, Deckers Outdoor down 16.9%, Ralph Lauren down 16.9%, and Nike down 13%. Each of these companies faces not only reduced consumer spending if a recession happens but also have overseas supply chains that would see significant tariff impacts if these tariffs take effect as presented on April 9th. Consumer Electronics: Dell is down 15.3%, HP is down 15.7%, and Best Buy is down 15.8%. Once again, these companies not only face reduced consumer demand but significant tariffs on their products. Apple was down 9% in early trading but has trimmed its losses to 7.9%. The post Live: Vanguard S&#038;P 500 ETF (VOO) Plummets 4% as Nike (NKE) and Dell (DELL) Sink appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

      "title": "I make $700k at a FAANG company but layoffs are coming – should I sell my U.S. homes and head back to Canada?",
      "content": "Key Points A Reddit user is concerned he is going to be laid off from his $700K job. He&#8217;s considering relocating, but he likely should keep his high paying job as long as he can. Shoring up his finances and starting to network for other work could help him maintain financial stability. Earn up to 3.8% on your money today (and get a cash bonus); click here to see how. (Sponsored) A Canadian working at a FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) job is currently making $700K per year while his pregnant wife stays home with the couple&#8217;s toddler. Unfortunately, as he posted on Reddit, he&#8217;s worried about potential layoffs at his company. He wasn&#8217;t given a promotion this year as the company was laying people off, and he&#8217;s also been unable to get a visa due to the layoffs. He&#8217;s also concerned that his temporary visa could be ended because of a potential trade war between the U.S. and Canada. Given the uncertainty about his professional future, he&#8217;s trying to decide what to do. He&#8217;s thinking about potentially selling his houses in the U.S. at a small loss and resettling in Canada; about paying down his mortgage so he&#8217;d earn enough rent to cover it and temporarily going to Canada or India and renting until things stabilize in the U.S.; or about just trying to hold on at work while expanding his emergency fund. So, what&#8217;s the best approach for him to deal with his current workplace uncertainty? Shoring up his finances and work skills could be a good option While the Reddit user may be worried about future layoffs, the fact is that he has not been laid off yet &#8212; and he is still making a $700K per year income. Giving up that job in anticipation of a possible layoff that may never come would likely be a foolish move. Instead, he can focus on making himself as indispensable as possible at work. While this may not guarantee he won&#8217;t be laid off, it still gives him a better shot at staying on the job and continuing to earn great pay. He can also start polishing up his resume, networking, and making professional connections. With a FAANG job as part of his employment history, he may easily be able to find other work in the U.S. even if he is laid off from his current position. This could help him to avoid having to sell his houses and disrupt his family just because of short-term economic issues. Regardless, since his job is uncertain, shoring up his financial situation would be a smart move. He should throw as much money as possible into a high-yield savings account right now. That way, this money will be there for him to live on temporarily if he loses his job. If he does end up having to move back to Canada because of problems with his visa resulting from a trade war, it would also be helpful to have these extra funds to pay for any costs. Since he really can&#8217;t predict the future, taking these steps to be as financially secure as possible, while keeping his high-paying job for as long as he can, should help set him up for a more secure future. A financial advisor can also help him find ways to free up more money to save and can also work with him to make different contingency plans and understand how they would impact his finances, so getting this professional advice would likely be a smart choice given the uncertainty of his ongoing situation.
