      "title": "Live Nasdaq Coverage: Nasdaq Composite Eyes Correction, TSM Bucks Downward Trend",
      "content": "The markets are extending yesterday’s tariff-induced sell-off, with all three of the major stock market indices trading deep in the red. The Nasdaq Composite is teetering on correction territory and is only 0.5% away as the tech slump continues. The Trump tariffs are now in effect, including a hefty 25% on Mexico and Canada as well as 20% on China imports. Corporate America is responding amid expectations of retaliatory tariffs that will cut into profits. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) is bucking the downward trend because it has committed to investing $100 billion in the U.S. on top of its previous commitment of $65 billion in a bid to sidestep tariffs. In a press conference with President Trump, Taiwan Semi CEO C.C. Wei said the company is “producing the most advanced chip made on U.S. soil” in Arizona, where it intends to build another three factories to create the world’s most powerful chips. TSM’s gains are failing to lift broader sentiment, with each of the Magnificent 7 stocks under pressure with the exception of Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), which is posting fractional gains. Yesterday, Apple CEO Tim Cook teased “something in the Air” that is coming this week. The gold price has been benefiting from the tariff fears and weaker U.S. dollar as investors seek out a hedge of protection asset. The gold price is trading at $2,920 per ounce today. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 636.35 (-1.4%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 315.06 (-1.68%) S&amp;P 500: Down 92.68 (-1.58%) Key Points Stocks are in freefall as the Trump tariffs take effect. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is encroaching on correction territory. Taiwan Semi is up on a robust spending plan the CEO outlined for the U.S. market. Market Movers Goldman Sachs has introduced the Goldman Sachs U.S. Large Cap Buffer 3 ETF (GBXC), its latest in a series of funds that are designed to provide downside protection to investors in the current uncertain climate. The buffer fund, as it’s known, will be reset on a quarterly basis and is designed to protect investors against losses between 5% and 15% in the corresponding S&amp;P 500 ETF. Consumer stocks like Hershey (NYSE: HSY), McDonald’s (NYSE: MCD) and PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) are all gaining ground as investors shift to a risk-off appetite. Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is spiraling nearly 8% on the day as it continues its whipsaw performance of late. Weak China sales are to blame, as the company’s China-manufactured vehicle sales drop to their lowest level in three years. Tesla’s performance is the result of China’s EV pricing wars that have come as a result of heightened competition in the country.

      "title": "1 Stock-Split AI Giant to Buy Before It Soars 93%, Says Wall Street Analyst",
      "content": "It’s probably going to be a long time before Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has a chance to split again. With shares back in bear market territory, the name may be at risk of falling back to the double-digits in short order. While such steep drops are nothing all too uncommon for the GPU juggernaut, this bear market dip does feel a bit more unnerving, thanks primarily to DeepSeek. While Nvidia is still the undisputed champ in AI GPUs, the trillion-dollar question is what happens when the next DeepSeek pops up. Undoubtedly, we seem to be trending towards lower-cost AI models and more those that can be run entirely on the edge. While models only stand to get cheaper and more portable with time, I still think the race on the high-end is still on. For instance, OpenAI recently delayed its launch of GPT-4.5, citing a GPU shortage as the reason for this. Key Points Nvidia stock is on the retreat. Yet, analysts are still sticking with the name as the firm readies its next-gen GPU. Nvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of ‘Next Nvidia Stocks’ that could be even better. Click here to learn more. OpenAI’s GPU shortage suggests Nvidia’s best days may not be behind it While it’s unclear when progress on the high-end (every firm wants that number-one spot currently held by OpenAI) will begin to slow, I do think that the rise of agentic AI, reasoning models, and other power-hungry models (perhaps AGI in the future?) will grow ever power-hungry. Perhaps DeepSeek’s existence doesn’t pull the plug on the race on the very cutting edge. Either way, the Magnificent Seven are betting a lot to advance the effort on the high-end, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is slated to spend $500 billion in four years in an effort that could see the iPhone maker pull ahead (perhaps to the front) in this AI race. Either way, things are about to get interesting in the deep end of the AI waters. And despite big tech’s efforts to insource AI chips, we’re still likely a long way off from a climate that would see Nvidia GPUs experience demand that’s less than heated. For now, it’s DeepSeek, tariff tremors, fatigue in the AI trade and rising competitive threats that have some NVDA shareholders more than willing to throw in the towel. Analysts are sticking with the name Don’t expect analysts to downgrade the stock just because of a bit of volatility. If anything, some upgrades may be in order, given the added value in buying the name on weakness. On the high-end, the most bullish analyst sees $220.00 as a price target on the stock. That entails a 93% gain from current levels. Until more bears step forward (they’re a rare breed when it comes to Nvidia), I’d not shy away from the name on weakness, as it could prove a wise contrarian bet. A high-growth stock on the cheap? Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood isn’t one of the doubters. She still views Nvidia as a high-growth play despite the recent margin forecast that startled investors. As shares of the GPU juggernaut come in again, perhaps dip-buyers, like Wood, will have more of an opportunity to pounce. After the latest slide, NVDA stock goes for 28.2 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) — that’s close to the cheapest it’s been all year. Only time will tell if Blackwell can reignite the stock. Indeed, there exists a scenario where DeepSeek and an efficiency boom is actually a boon for Nvidia as an increasing number of players (think startups and firms we haven’t heard about) look to buy their own picks and shovels to get in on the AI gold rush. Even if they don’t get the highest-quality picks and shovels, they can still unearth quite a bit of gold for themselves. Either way, I find it hard not to be more enticed by shares of NVDA now that they’re trading at forward P/E multiples that are lower than some rival Mag Seven members. Who knows? Nvidia may be a relative value option as investors turn on an AI trade that may still have legs.

      "title": "Donald Trump Campaigned on Cutting Corporate Taxes – Where Does That Promise Stand Today?",
      "content": "President Donald J. Trump’s 2024 electoral campaign was buoyed by the hope that his leadership would return the economic prosperity of his previous term, which had been decimated by Bidenomics and rampant Congressional spending, fueling inflation to the worst levels in 40 years. Central to President Trump’s strong economic performance from 2016-2020 was the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. TCHA resulted in unprecedented business growth, new entrepreneurism, historically low unemployment among all ethnic groups, and consumer confidence soaring to an 18-year high. The 21% corporate rate is one of the few permanent aspects to TCJA not subject to expiration. President Trump has been adamant about the need to renew TCJA, as other key provisions expire in December, 2025. He is also proposing additional tax cuts, such as taxes on overtime, tips, Social Security payments, and has even proposed eliminating federal income tax altogether, to be replaced with revenues from a national consumption tax and tariffs. However, analysts have debated the merits of further tax cuts, the impact on the national debt, and whether or not Congress would ultimately be able to legislate these proposals into law. Key Points The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) delivered unprecedented business growth and entrepreneurism, in addition to additional retained money in the pockets of a majority of American citizens. President Trump campaigned on cutting taxes further on a number of fronts, including renewal of TCJA before its expiration in December, 2025. Many analysts who have debated over the effectiveness of further tax cuts fail to include the massive regulatory cuts, the large pending reductions in wasteful spending being identified by DOGE, and the resultant job creation, business growth, and fresh investment into US business as a result of the tariff policies.

Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Arguments Against Tax Cuts and The Truth Senator Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is one of the main opponents to tax cuts and reduced spending that take away power from Democrats&#8217; pet projects. Not surprisingly, the entirety of elected Democrats, as well as left-leaning Republicans, have been the loudest voices against cutting taxes. Democrat leaders like Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have been among the more articulate critics, although their mantras about “tax cuts would only be for the top 1%” and that “the rich don’t pay their fair share” have been thoroughly debunked by genuine statistics and even left leaning Factcheck.org. In actuality, TCJA benefited over 75% of all US taxpayers, and it has been verified that the top 1%, in fact, pay 40% of the entirety of federal income tax. The Congressional Budget Office’s analysis projects that a TCJA extension would create increased deficits based on reduced tax revenues from present levels. It forecasts a $4.6 trillion shortfall over 10 years, accounting for interest on outstanding federal debt. The Tax Policy Center projected that economic growth would offset only 6% of the shortfall. One crucial point is that neither the CBO or TPC prognostications take into account any significant spending cuts nor how tariffs will accelerate cutting deficits, as well as other key policy ramifications already in effect in the Trump Administration: How tariffs are creating fresh US investment, new businesses, and more crucial private sector jobs. The impact of lower tax rates and the elimination of onerous Biden-imposed regulatory burdens are jump-starting new manufacturing and other major business creation. How ending potential trillions in fraudulent, misappropriated, and likely criminal spending waste from USAID and numerous other federal agencies uncovered by DOGE will accelerate the goal towards eliminating the trillions in federal debt overhang via drastically reduced spending. Why a national consumption tax effectively rebuts Democrat opponents’ claims of “unfairness” and “only favoring the rich”. Trump Fiscal Policy Results In The First 60+ Days Cutting the trillions of wasteful and criminal spending of taxpayer dollars uncovered by Elon Musk and DOGE could accelerate President Trump&#8217;s plans to fix the US economy and restore manufacturing and other critical businesses. Since taking office in January, the threat of Trump&#8217;s tariffs has already created a seismic shift in the corporate business environment. For example: In response to prospective 25% tariffs on products made in Taiwan, Taiwan Semiconductor, the maker of all of the GPUs from Nvidia and AMD required to run Artificial Intelligence, announced a $100 billion investment into new factories to be located in AZ for making GPUs and other semiconductor products expressly for the US market. SoftBank Group Corp. from Japan pledged to invest $50 billion in the US to create 50,000 new jobs. Apple announced it invested $500 billion for AI servers to be built in Michigan and Texas, creating 20,000 new jobs. Oracle, ChatGPT, and OpenAI announced its Stargate JV would invest up to $500 billion for AI infrastructure construction, creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs in various states, commencing with Texas. The revival of US-manufactured steel and copper is already underway, thanks to US tariffs to prevent dumping from China and other nations into the US market. Additionally, Elon Musk’s DOGE has been uncovering misappropriated taxpayer funds, payments to nonexistent recipients, and useless pork projects ostensibly designed to serve as political kickbacks and bribes to overseas entities, all of which are in the process of being cut. The anticipated spending cuts, something not factored into the CBO calculations, could drastically accelerate the rate of reducing the federal debt. A recent CBS poll found that 77% of the American public supports the work of DOGE. Lastly, a consumption tax, proposed as a 14-17% tax on all new goods except for food and medicine, would be a tax that visibly and unequivocally hits the wealthiest the hardest, thus debunking any accusations about unfairness. With no loopholes, a flat consumption tax is based on the value of the purchased item. Since expensive goods that are only affordable for the wealthy have a higher price tag, the commensurate tax revenues from those items will generate more tax revenues. President Trump was given a mandate by the electorate. While he has already enacted some of his plans to good effect, his tax and regulatory cutting proposals will still require much combating with Democrats, the predominant recipients of high taxes and big government spending. Over the next 4 years, the results of these battles will determine the extent of the initiatives’ full financial benefits.

      "title": "The Most Expensive Failed Startups of All Time",
      "content": "In the history of the business world, it should go without saying that far more companies fail than succeed. This is an unfortunate truth, with as many as 20% of new businesses failing in their first year, 50% within 5 years and 65% within 10 years. Only 35% of companies, or around one-third according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, can celebrate a ten-year mark. Key Points It&#8217;s an unfortunate truth that more startups fail than succeed. The hope is that you don&#8217;t expand too quickly without ensuring a solid business foundation. Sometimes, ideas are too early to market, as Webvan shows, as grocery delivery is now widespread. 4 million Americans are set to retire this year. If you want to join them, click here now to see if you’re behind, or ahead. It only takes a minute. (Sponsor) The most challenging point for some businesses, especially founders and CEOs, is that their failures are very public. It’s one thing to fail and disappoint yourself and your family, but it’s an entirely different thing to fail on a global scale, let go of employees, and see yourself in headlines worldwide. 10. Pets.com Founded: 1998 Defunct: 2000 Amount lost: $110 million Why it failed: An unsustainable business model based on too high shipping costs The Dot-Com Burst The poster child for the dot-com era going bust, Pets.com was a company born in 1998 and with its massive war chest of startup money, it looked to conquer the pet product delivery market. On the positive side, Pets.com saw an influx of customer activity and orders, but company management spent too much on advertising before the company was bringing in enough revenue. As a result, the company went defunct after just two short years and while it may not be the most expensive failed startup, it’s one of the most memorable. 9. Anki Founded: 2010 Defunct: 2019 Amount lost: $205 million Why it failed: High-profile promise that was unable to meet customer expectations Robots For All The promise of Anki was a welcome one as an American robotics and AI startup that manufactured small robots for children. After receiving over $200 million in investments, the hope was that robots like Cozmo and Vector had emotional intelligence, making them a more ideal play “toy” for children. Unfortunately, the company failed to secure its last round of financing and its only place on the market was a palm-size toy that provided gibberish chitchat with children. 8. Abound Solar Founded: 2007 Defunct: 2012 Amount lost: $614 million Why it failed: Unproven technology and high costs were too much for the solar industry Affordable Solar Panels One of two solar startups to rank among the most expensive failed startups of all time, Abound Solar lost its investors almost $614 million over five years. In an industry where price is everything, Abound Solar didn’t have the right technology or at least reliable enough technology to reduce costs low enough to meet customer demand. Separately, this company should be a lesson on not relying too heavily on government subsidies that don’t help businesses avoid marketplace realities. 7. Webvan Founded: 1996 Defunct: 2001 Amount lost: $800 million Why it failed: Didn’t have the correct scale to match an overly ambitious delivery rollout service Groceries To Your Door The idea of door-to-door grocery delivery is a fantastic one that hits all the right spots today with services like Instacart, Shipt, and Walmart+. However, before these services, Webvan tried out a similar business starting in 1999, but it expanded too fast without building up the right amount of demand. Unfortunately, it spent a ton of money without a solid customer base and profits to sustain its quick growth. In other words, Webvan should have tested demand in a few markets before expanding. 6. Theranos Founded: 2003 Defunct: 2018 Amount invested: $700 million &#8211; $1.4 billion Why it failed: Inaccurate and misleading claims about technology Total Fraud Arguably the best-known name on this list, Theranos has become something of the poster-child for failed startups. With hundreds of millions in investments from some of the world’s wealthiest families like the Waltons, Carlos Slim, Betsy Devos, and more, Theranos promised a revolutionary blood-test process. Unfortunately, the technology wasn’t real and the company that was at one time worth $9 billion went up in smoke leaving investors holding the bag on everything and its CEO in jail. 5. Jawbone Founded: 1999 Defunct: 2017 Amount lost: $900 million Why it failed: Failure to properly market and sell its products Not So Wearable Before the Apple Watch helped solidify the wearable market once and for all, Jawbone attempted to do the same thing. Established in 1999, the company was heavily focused on wearables, Bluetooth headphones, and wireless speakers. Venture capitalists poured money into the company, giving it a $3.2 billion evaluation at its peak, but the best Jawbone could manage was only capturing 3% of the market by 2015 before it wound itself down in 2017. 4. Better Place Founded: 2007 Defunct: 2013 Amount lost: $850 &#8211; $900 million Why it failed: Mismanagement, increasing infrastructure costs The Pre-Tesla An electric vehicle startup founded by entrepreneur Shai Agassi in 2007, Better Place was poised to look as big, if not bigger, than Tesla. Raising between $850 and $900 million in capital, the company looked to build battery-swapping stations so users could extend the range of their cars. Unfortunately, infrastructure costs were high and the company couldn’t keep operations going indefinitely. 3. Solyndra Founded: 2005 Defunct: 2011 Amount lost: $1.2 billion Why it failed: Could not compete with conventional solar panel manufacturers The Solar Flare Out One of the most heavily promoted startups of all time, Solyndra seemed so promising that even the Obama administration offered them $535 million in loans alongside $1.2 billion in private fundraising. Unfortunately, timing is everything in the startup world, and Solyndra’s timing couldn’t have been worse in 2011, as prices tanked for many of the materials it needed to make its panels. As a result, the company folded and the hope for widespread solar technology along with it. 2. LeSports Founded: 2014 Defunct: 2017 Amount lost: $1.7 billion Why it failed: LeSports faced financial mismanagement while overpaying for broadcasting rights Streaming Failures With an investment of $1.7 billion, LeSports was poised to dominate the Hong Kong sports streaming industry. Backed by a cadre of big investors, the company suffered from poor management and aggressive expansion that left it unable to pay rent on its buildings at one point. The biggest lesson here is to ensure a sustainable revenue model before going to market and not to expand too quickly without ensuring profitability first. 1. Quibi Founded: 2018 Defunct: 2020 Amount lost: $1.75 billion Why it failed: Niche, mobile-only content didn’t resonate with the audience Most Expensive Of All-Time Widely considered the most expensive failed start-up of all time, Quibi couldn’t have been in a better place to succeed. With more than $1.75 billion invested, two massively well-known entertainment and business co-founders, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman, the mobile-only short-form content didn’t resonate with audiences. Quibi was too early to market with 10-minute episodes. Unlike TikTok, which is creator-focused, Quibi was too close to traditional television, which was its ultimate downfall.
