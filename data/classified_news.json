These concerns are driven by President Donald Trump&rsquo;s plan to impose a new round of tariffs&mdash;widely referred to as &ldquo;liberation day&rdquo; tariffs&mdash;which are expected to be announced on Wednesday at 4:00 PM ET. These tariffs could target a broad range of U.S. trading partners, intensifying fears of a recession.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li class=\"\" data-start=\"1218\" data-end=\"1672\">\r\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"1220\" data-end=\"1672\"><strong data-start=\"1220\" data-end=\"1243\">Policy Uncertainty:</strong><br data-start=\"1243\" data-end=\"1246\" />Trump&rsquo;s history of announcing and delaying tariffs has added to the market&rsquo;s unease. The upcoming announcement could further disrupt global trading relationships and fuel additional market volatility.
