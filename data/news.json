GE Aerospace, a key division, focuses on manufacturing jet engines and providing related services. The company competes with other aerospace giants like Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney. Recently, Bernstein maintained an \"Outperform\" rating for GE, with the stock priced at <strong>$205.88</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Bernstein's decision to raise the price target for GE Aerospace from $232 to $250 is supported by the division's recent achievements. GE Aerospace secured a major contract with Korean Air to supply GEnx and GE9X engines for their Boeing 787-10 and 777-9 aircraft. This deal strengthens GE's position in the aerospace market and highlights its technological prowess.</p>\n\n<p>The GEnx engine family, with over 62 million flight hours, is a testament to GE's engineering excellence. With more than 3,600 engines in service or on backlog, the GEnx engine powers two-thirds of all Boeing 787 aircraft. The GE9X engine, chosen by Korean Air, offers a <strong>10%</strong> improvement in fuel efficiency over its predecessor, enhancing the airline's operational efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>Korean Air's decision to select GE Aerospace engines underscores the strong partnership between the two companies. The order includes a service agreement for maintenance, repair, and overhaul of the GE9X engines, marking a first in South Korea. This collaboration aligns with Korean Air's vision of fleet expansion and excellence, as highlighted by Walter Cho, Chairman and CEO of Korean Air.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the positive developments, GE's stock price has seen a slight decrease of $1.49, or approximately <strong>-0.72%</strong>, currently trading at <strong>$205.88</strong>. The stock has fluctuated between $202.80 and $207.69 today, with a market capitalization of around <strong>$220.97 billion</strong>. Over the past year, GE's stock has ranged from a low of $133.99 to a high of $214.21, reflecting its dynamic market presence.</p>",
