      "title": "My Top 3 ETF’s I Would Put $10,000 In Today",
      "content": "Key Points Looking for high-yield ETFs? These three popular ETFs will never disappoint you. Each ETF is highly diversified, low-cost, low risk and pays steady dividends. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Market volatility in 2025 has driven investors towards safer assets like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). By investing in ETFs, you not only build a highly diversified portfolio but also generate steady income and hold some of the top companies. You do not have to pick individual stocks to make money. ETFs are a low-cost option of investing in stocks and they reduce company-specific risks. If you’re looking for the best ETFs to invest in this year, I’ve identified 3 where I’d put my $10,000 today. Since no two funds are equal, you need to weigh each based on your personal financial goals and risk appetite. JP Morgan Equity Premium ETF The J.P. Morgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI) is a covered call ETF that invests in the top S&amp;P 500 stocks. These stocks are known for little risk and steady returns. It offers a monthly payout and invests in the top U.S. blue-chip companies. The ETF enjoys an attractive 30-day SEC yield of 11.38% and holds 126 stocks. Since it is a covered call ETF, the fund buys stocks and then sells call options on them, this gives the buyers a chance to make a profit. While investors get a share in some profits, most are drawn to the high dividend yield. JEPI has an expense ratio of 0.35% and its NAV is $56.04. The ETF has remained flat in the year but the dividend yield makes it worth a consideration. Since it owns elite names and holds dividend-paying companies, it ensures a steady income for investors. Its holdings include: Information Technology: 15.8% Financials: 13% Industrials: 12.8% Healthcare: 11.3% The ETF also owns some of the Magnificent Seven, namely, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla. None of the stocks have a weightage higher than 2%. Despite investing the majority of the funds in the tech sector, JEPI reduces the sector-specific risks with its highly diversified portfolio. Even if the ETF moves sideways in the short term, investors can benefit from the steady passive income. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF If you are looking for a fund that is not tech-heavy, the Schwab U.S. Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD) is a smart choice. The fund offers the potential for income and growth. It holds 103 stocks and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 index. It has an expense ratio of 0.06% and a 30-day SEC yield of 3.81%. While the ETF has a slightly lower dividend yield, it offers capital appreciation. The NAV of the fund is $26.90 and it is up 4.38% in 12 months and over 50% in five years. The fund holdings include: Energy: 21.08% Consumer staples: 19.06% Healthcare: 15.68% Industrials: 12.45% None of the stocks in the ETF have a weightage higher than 5% and the top holdings include popular names like Cisco, ConocoPhillips, Texas Instruments, Coca-Cola, and Chevron Corporation. These are some of the dividend-paying companies. If you’re a passive income investor looking for a low-risk investment option, SCHD is a great choice. The ETF offers a wide range of top-quality dividend stocks to help build your passive income portfolio. SCHD isn’t tech-heavy, meaning you do not have to worry about your returns during volatility. The highly diversified portfolio owns elite names and pay quarterly dividends. JP Morgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF The JP Morgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ: JEPQ) invests in the Nasdaq 100 and holds stocks that have little volatility. It holds 108 stocks and has a 30-day SEC yield of 14.47%. JEPQ has an expense ratio of 0.35% and focuses heavily on tech. The fund holdings include: Information technology: 42.4% Other: 16.5% Communication services: 12.9% Consumer discretionary: 12.1% I believe that the future is tech and by investing in JEPQ, it is possible to reduce the company-specific risks while holding the top tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft. The top 10 stocks in the fund form 44.34% of the portfolio and these are tech companies except for Costco. The tech sector has rallied in the past and once the economy improves, we could see it pick pace again. JEPQ has an NAV of $52.59 and is down 4.87% in 12 months. Since the fund focuses on high yield, the capital appreciation could be limited. However, I believe the fund has the potential to keep rewarding investors with a solid yield. JEPI and JEPQ both have a solid dividend yield and the fund is handled by the experts at JP Morgan, making it low-risk and highly reliable. JEPQ pays monthly dividends and offers a balanced portfolio of elite heavyweights. The low-stress ETF is one of the best placess to invest $10,000 today.

      "title": "Why the Nifty 50 is Better Than the S&P 500",
      "content": "Among major market indices, the S&amp;P 500 is the go-to index for the broader stock market. It represents 500 of the top companies that trade in the stock market based on their market capitalizations. But on a global scale, the S&amp;P 500 isn&#8217;t the only game in town and arguably could take a page out of India&#8217;s comparable index — the Nifty 50 — for even better results. Indian stocks have several tailwinds, including rising investments into the Southeast Asian region. Last year thrust the Nifty 50 into the spotlight when it began beating the S&amp;P 500 on returns, and now investors are wondering if they might be missing out. It&#8217;s not that the S&amp;P 500 has a poor track record. It has gained a reputation as the go-to index for market exposure, comparisons and ETF tracking. It&#8217;s components set the standard for quarterly earnings performance, dividends and returns. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 carries more than three-quarters of the total stock market&#8217;s value, and it is held by investors big and small either through direct exposure or investment funds. We&#8217;re talking about high-flying names like NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), to name a few. Over the five-year stretch leading up to 2024, the S&amp;P 500 delivered average yearly returns of 13.6%, or 8.9% adjusted for inflation. While it&#8217;s nothing to balk at, India&#8217;s market has growth on its side. India&#8217;s Nifty 50 is a younger, more nimble index that has the ability to do things that a larger index in a greater economy is not in a position to easily replicate. With names like Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank and Tata Consultancy, the Southeast Asian index has a great deal of growth to offer investors. Key Points in This Article: Emerging economies present tremendous upside potential as American equities face unprecedented uncertainty. One analysis suggests a return of nearly 700% for the Nifty 50 index in dollar terms vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 321% over the past 25 years.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Nifty 50 Mechanics Serving as India’s premier stock market index, the Nifty 50 is the cornerstone benchmark for the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Its function is similar to that of the S&amp;P 500 in the U.S., acting as a measure of the Indian equity market’s overall performance while also reflecting investor sentiment. Since its debut in the mid-1990s, India&#8217;s index has tracked the performance of 50 of the biggest and most actively traded Indian companies on the NSE. Performance It feels counterintuitive to bet against the U.S. stock market, so that is not the purpose of this argument. Nevertheless, the Nifty 50 has had an impressive run of late. Over the past couple of decades, the Nifty 50 has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in certain analyses. While a basic comparison might be influenced by currency fluctuations, studies that adjust for the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar reveal the Nifty 50 delivering higher returns than the U.S. index. One analysis, in particular, suggests a return of nearly 700% for the Nifty 50 index in dollar terms vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 321% over the past 25 years. Much of this outperformance has unfolded over the past five years or so while India&#8217;s GDP has been expanding quickly amid policy support as well as domestic and international investment, which has widened the gap dramatically. For investors seeking to capitalize on a rapidly expanding economy, the Nifty 50 has arguably been a more compelling vehicle. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s important to note that the Indian economy is coming from a lower base than that of the U.S. economy and therefore also carries with it greater risk. The U.S. economy is valued at $27.7 trillion compared with India&#8217;s GDP of approximately $3.6 trillion. Smaller Cohort Secondly, you can argue that the Nifty 50 offers a more focused, high-quality play on India&#8217;s elite corporate sector. As an index of only 50 companies, it represents only the biggest and most liquid companies on the National Stock Exchange. This makes it a useful benchmark for investors who want exposure to India’s blue-chip leaders. These include stable, leading players in key sectors like financial services, technology and energy. For a new investor in the Indian market, this smaller, more focused list can be easier to understand and follow. Lower Base Finally, while the S&amp;P 500 represents a mature, developed market, the Nifty 50 is a direct bet on a still-developing economy with a GDP that is growing by leaps and bounds. This offers the potential for greater growth. Despite some of the volatility that comes with emerging market status, the Nifty 50 is seen as a key indicator of India’s economic health, and its performance has reflected the country’s strong growth of late. This combination of stability among its top companies and exposure to a high-growth economy makes for a compelling investment thesis.

      "title": "QQQI vs. JEPQ: Which ETF is the True Dividend King?",
      "content": "Key Points The NASDAQ-100 is a volatile index that offers considerable long term upside amidst its intraday turbulence. Use of financial derivatives for both risk mitigation and for potentially larger leveraged gains has become routine in the financial world, especially for QQQI and JEPQ. To qualify as a “Dividend King”, a stock must have a track record of 50 or more consecutive years of dividend increases due to the underlying issuing company’s intrinsic growth. ETF “dividend kings” are metaphorical, but may reference a head to head comparison. Are you ahead or behind on your retirement goals?

Don’t waste another minute – get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Seven of the top largest S&amp;P 500 stocks by market cap are tech industry companies that have been dubbed “The Magnificent 7” due to their remarkable tandem bull run over the past several years. These stocks are:: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Meta Platforms (Facebook), Nvidia, and Tesla. In order to give better focus on the tech and other higher growth sectors, which tend to be listed on NASDAQ, the NASDAQ-100 index was created to track the top 100 NASDAQ listed companies that are not in the financial sector, as the tech emphasis also purports to emphasize innovation and new products instead of financial companies, which ostensibly do not. The launch of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that track the NASDAQ-100 index was a foregone conclusion, and several of them already vie for investor dollars on a daily basis. Two that have exhibited sizable growth but have been able to augment their gains in the form of dividends, are: The NEOS Nasdaq-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ: QQQI), and the JP Morgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ: JEPQ). Ironically, both indexes generate their high yields through strategic innovations that rival those in the tech sector, in terms of their potential to deliver performance enhancements for their assigned tasks. How QQQI and JEPQ Compare &#8211; An Overview Both QQQI and JEPQ track the NASDAQ 1oo ETF, which is very volatile, due to its heavy weighting in the technology sector. Both ETFs are still relatively young. QQQI only launched in January, 2024 and JEPQ began in May, 2022. The following details are based on market price at the time of this writing: Category QQQI JEPQ Yield 14.55% 11.28% Net Assets $1.76 billion $26.27 billion Average Daily Volume 970,269 shares 7.29 million shares Expense Ratio 0.68% 0.35% Beta 0.00 0.83 52-week range 41.17-54.47 44.31-58.54 1-year return 14.37% 7.69% 1-year trailing return 15.24% 8.49% 3-year return n/a 14.40% Largest Hedge Fund Holder Second Half Financial Ptnrs Fisher Asset Mgmt. Sector Weighting #1 Technology &#8211; 52.41% Technology &#8211; 51.41% Sector Weighting #2 Communication Svc &#8211; 16.09% Communication Svc &#8211; 15.90% Sector Weighting #3 Consumer Cyclical &#8211; 12.85% Consumer Cyclical &#8211; 14.60% JEPQ Top 5 Holdings Symbol/Exchange Company Percentage MSFT Microsoft Corp. 7.49% NVDA Nvidia Corp 7.35% AAPL Apple, Inc. 6.47% AMZN Amazon 4.92% GOOG Alphabet Class C 3.99% QQQI Top 5 Holdings Symbol/Exchange Company Percentage MSFT Microsoft Corp. 8.61% NVDA Nvidia Corp 8.30% AAPL Apple, Inc. 7.59% AMZN Amazon 4.87% AVGO Broadcom 4.74% Strategic Differences Although they both utilize covered call options for creating dividends, JEPQ&#8217;s use of ELNs is more conservative than QQQI&#8217;s direct trading of out of the money calls in addition to its portfolio covered call writing. Both JEPQ and QQQI utilize option strategies to artificially create dividends for their shareholders. However there are both mechanical and risk/reward differences in their respective approaches. JEPQ uses Equity Linked Notes (ELNs), which are synthetic financial products created by financial institutions, and are linked to a particular index or stock. ELNs usually have a call option attached to a principal protection component, and can be likened to a short-term zero-coupon bond with a maturity of no longer than a few months. The returns on the ELN are linked to the underlying index or stock. Additionally, most, if not all ELNs are purchased directly from the issuer and held to maturity. There is no secondary market for ELNs. JEPQ manager Hamilton Reiner staggers one-month calls into multiple weekly buckets, then diversifies the expiration dates and strike prices. However, Reiner conducts this strategy with purchases of ELNs that give the JEPQ exposure to the profits on those call options, without the risk of any of the top tech stock holdings being subject to calls if the market takes off and the calls go in-the-money. Conversely, QQQI also utilizes a covered call strategy, in addition to out of the money call purchases to augment upside gains. QQQI writes their covered calls directly against the NASDAQ-100 index up to 100% of the equity value of total QQQI holdings. The fund then uses a portion of their covered call premium income to purchase out of the money call options. This give it the following result scenarios: If the market ends relatively flat, QQQI has kept the premium income minus the cost of the out of the money options. If the market jumps up, the underwritten covered call is already hedged against stocks, but QQQI can take profit on the out of the money call that ostensibly would be in the money due to the jump. Overall Analysis and The King of the Hill In This Competition For 1 year&#8217;s yield comparison, QQQI wins the &#8220;King of the Hill&#8221; contest against JEPQ, but has 49 years to go of upping the yield ante annually before being able to claim a &#8220;Dividend King&#8221; title. Selling covered calls is considered a viable strategy to mitigate volatility and take advantage of market volatility, which usually means increased delta and subsequently larger premiums. However, there is a reason why there is a sizable enough market on the buy side &#8211; there are enough people who think the option will increase in value. However, selling calls can limit interim upside, especially if the goal is for the option to expire worthless so the same underlying securities can cover another call writing opportunity next month. President Thomas Jefferson was once quoted, “ With risk comes great reward.” QQQI’s superior yield is a testament to the reward from being more aggressive and taking on more risk than JEPQ. However, with only slightly over 1 years’ worth of trading history and returns from which to judge, QQQI may be the dividend “king of the hill” only for the moment. Whether a consistent track record can be built or not on the QQQI strategy model, which needs to be actively managed by their presumably disciplined managers, remains to be seen. Since both companies’ dividends are artificially created through trading against market volatility, as opposed to intrinsic enhanced value through a business, the ability for JEPQ and QQQI rests solely on skill and knowledge of its managers. If they can first reach Dividend Aristocrat status (25 or more years of consecutive, annual dividend increases), then perhaps a hypothetical Dividend King discussion (50 consecutive years or more of dividend increases) can be had.

      "title": "Jim Cramer: ‘Trump Discount’ Is Hurting Markets",
      "content": "Key Points in This Article: CNBC’s Mad Money host Jim Cramer is often criticized for inaccurate stock picks that inspire routine bets against his calls as a better way to beat the market. Due to his unreliable predictions and over-the-top policy complaints, investors would be better served by focusing on company fundamentals. Nvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of &#8216;Next Nvidia Stocks&#8217; that could be even better. Click here to learn more. A Controversial Track Record Jim Cramer is a polarizing figure in financial media, known for hosting CNBC’s Mad Money and co-anchoring Squawk on the Street. A Harvard-educated former hedge fund manager, Cramer’s high-energy stock picks and market commentary have made him a household name among retail investors. However, his predictions are frequently criticized for their inconsistency, with many noting he’s often wrong about his stock calls. This reputation led to the creation of the Inverse Cramer ETF, which aimed to profit by betting against his recommendations. Although the ETF shut down due to lack of interest, an X account named “Inverse Cramer” continues to mock his calls, highlighting his spotty track record. Cramer’s bold, sometimes erratic takes &#8212; such a a recent essay he wrote on a so-called “Trump discount” &#8212; often spark debate, with critics pointing to his tendency to overemphasize short-term noise over long-term fundamentals, making his advice a risky bet for investors. Cramer’s “Trump Discount” Thesis In his June 1 article, Jim Cramer argues that a “Trump discount” is suppressing U.S. stock market performance due to the unpredictability of President Trump’s policies. He contrasts Europe’s “consistency of mediocrity” with U.S. volatility, claiming the White House’s immense power creates instability. Cramer cites examples across sectors: Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) gains were short-lived due to policy uncertainty; retail stocks like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) face tariff-related confusion; drug companies suffer from shifting Medicare pricing policies and vaccine skepticism; food companies like Campbell’s (NYSE:CPB) face regulatory pressure from RFK Jr.; Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) struggles with Trump’s push for U.S.-only manufacturing; software and internet giants like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) face unexpected scrutiny; banks see no regulatory relief; mergers and acquisitions are stalled by unpredictable cash flows; and energy stocks, despite Trump’s pro-drilling stance, lack momentum due to high costs and regulatory hurdles. Cramer predicts continued market declines, noting a recent 1% S&amp;P 500 drop, exacerbated by mixed signals about U.S.-China trade talks. Flaws in Cramer’s Argument Cramer’s thesis appears flawed for several reasons. First, his “Trump discount” overstates the impact of presidential policies on broad market performance. The S&amp;P 500, far from being discounted, has gained since he wrote his article, and is near record highs, contradicting his bearish outlook. Second, his sector-specific arguments lack depth. Nvidia’s volatility is more tied to market cycles and competition than Trump’s policies. Retailers like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and TJX (NYSE:TJX) have thrived despite tariff fears, with Costco’s stock rising due to strong fundamentals, not a “Trump premium.” Third, Cramer’s focus on short-term policy noise ignores long-term drivers like corporate earnings and consumer demand. His concerns about drug stocks, which he ties to RFK Jr.’s influence, overstate the impact of unconfirmed regulatory changes, since Medicare negotiation frameworks remain complex and slow-moving. Similarly, his critique of Apple misinterprets global supply chain dynamics; India’s manufacturing shift is a strategic diversification, not a policy misstep. Cramer’s Track Record and Market Misreads Cramer’s historical inaccuracy fuels skepticism. The Inverse Cramer ETF, though defunct, capitalized on his poor track record, and the ongoing X account highlights his frequent misses. His alarmist tone, comparing Trump’s influence to Andrew Jackson’s era, exaggerates political impact while downplaying market resilience. For instance, energy stocks’ stagnation is less about Trump’s policies and more about global oil prices and ESG pressures, which Cramer barely addresses. His claim that Europe’s markets outperform due to “consistency” ignores their own challenges, like Germany’s 2025 economic slowdown. By fixating on sensationalized policy risks, Cramer overlooks broader market trends, such as technology-driven gains and robust consumer spending, which have propelled the S&amp;P 500 upward. Key Takeaways As always, focus on fundamentals, not noise. Investors should tune out sky-is-falling narratives like Cramer’s, which amplify short-term concerns over fundamentals. However, blind optimism about endless market gains is equally misguided. Markets naturally rise and fall, influenced by policies but driven by earnings, innovation, and economic cycles. While presidential actions, like tariffs or deregulation, can create volatility, they don’t dictate long-term outcomes. Investors would do well to focus on business fundamentals &#8212; revenue growth, profit margins, and competitive advantages &#8212; rather than reacting to pundits like Cramer. Consistent, long-term investing, diversified across sectors, remains the most reliable path to wealth creation, regardless of political headlines.

Apple Stock Bump 11:10 am by Gerelyn Terzo Bank of America analysts have reaffirmed their &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock, pointing to the App Store results as a positive catalyst. Earlier this week, Jefferies analysts lifted their outlook on Apple shares to &#8220;hold&#8221; from &#8220;underperform.&#8221; Apple stock is up 0.78% today but is down 14% year-to-date. Fed in Focus 9:58 am by Gerelyn Terzo With today&#8217;s strong jobs data, indicating a healthy economy, Wall Street analysts are predicting what to expect when Fed policymakers convene next. Here&#8217;s a roundup of some of the commentary: BMO&#8217;s Ian Lyngen remarked, “Overall, it was a strong set of data that implies the Fed will remain on hold later this month, leaving rate cut expectations focused on the September FOMC meeting.” Mutual of America Capital Management CEO Joe Gaffoglio wrote, “The June jobs report continues to demonstrate resilience across the labor market, even as certain sectors such as manufacturing continue to lag. The unemployment rate is holding steady at 4.1%, and real average hourly earnings for employees experienced its largest increase of the year.” Goldman Sachs&#8217; Head of Fixed Income Macro Strategies Simon Dangoor commented: “Today’s stronger jobs report confirms a still resilient U.S. labor market, defying, at least for now, the signs of weakness seen in some leading indicators. The FOMC’s conviction that it should hold its wait-and-see stance while it braces for an acceleration in inflation over the summer will only be strengthened. But we still see a path to a resumption of the Fed’s easing cycle later in the year should the summer acceleration in inflation prove more modest than expected.” This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are celebrating a stronger-than-expected jobs report for June, sending all three of the major stock market indices higher. The economy added 147,000 payrolls last month, far outpacing economist forecasts calling for a slowdown in hiring. Meanwhile, past data was revised upward, while the unemployment rate dropped from 4.2% to 4.1%, once again outshining most expectations. The Nasdaq Composite is on pace for yet another record high, as is the broader S&amp;P 500 market index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.28%. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green today, led by telecom, consumer discretionary and technology. Big Tech is driving much of the gains in the Nasdaq Composite today, including a 2% rise in Meta Technologies (Nasdaq: META) amid an analyst upgrade at Needham, which has assigned a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the stock, up from &#8220;underperform.&#8221; Elon Musk weighed in on X, asking in delight, &#8220;They had a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating on Zuck?&#8221; Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 149.16 (+0.34%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 125.10 (+0.61%) S&amp;P 500: Up 29.48 (+0.48%) Market Movers Datadog (Nasdaq: DDOG), which is behind a cloud-based security platform, is advancing 9.1% today after being chosen as the latest addition to the S&amp;P 500, replacing the outgoing Juniper Networks, which is being acquired by Hewlett Packard (NYSE: HPE). With the index inclusion, DDOG will gain exposure to more institutional and retail portfolios including through ETFs. Synopsys (Nasdaq: SNPS) is gaining 4.4% after the U.S. withdrew U.S. &#8220;chip design software curbs on China,&#8221; per reports. Tripadvisor (Nasdaq: TRIP) is soaring 11.5% today on the heels of an investment by activist investor Starboard, which after taking a 9% position in the stock called the shares undervalued.

      "title": "Warren Buffett’s Best Investment Quote",
      "content": "A recent list of Warren Buffett’s best quotes includes his primary view of investing. It represents sound advice that is as good as that provided by any seasoned investor: &#8220;The first rule of an investment is don&#8217;t lose (money). And the second rule of an investment is don&#8217;t forget the first rule. And that&#8217;s all the rules there are.&#8221; 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: One of Warren Buffett’s best pieces of investment advice is not to lose money. He may have lost money on some investments, but not enough to offset his overall spectacular returns. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) A $100 investment in his flagship company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B), which he took over in 1965, was worth $5.5 million at the end of last year. Some of this growth is due to financial companies that he favors and has acquired. This includes insurance company GEICO and several reinsurance companies. However, the largest private corporation he owns is the massive railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe Company. Two investments demonstrate the diversification of Buffett’s holdings. One is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) (some of which he sold off recently), and the other is the Chinese EV company BYD. He purchased many of his BYD shares in 2008 when the company was still an obscure carmaker. That investment of $230 million is worth $2.4 billion. BYD sells more EVs than Tesla does. Some of his investments are in America’s oldest companies. These are also some of America’s valuable and visible brands. Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) was launched in 1886. Berkshire Hathaway was a significant company before Buffett took over in 1965. Kroger Inc. (NYSE: KR) was founded in 1883. American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) got its start in 1850. All were part of Buffett’s holdings in the first quarter of 2025. He has held some of these for most of this century. These represent part of his investment rules and philosophies. Often among the best investments are companies that have been industry giants and successful since before Buffett was born in 1930. He and his staff can examine earnings, business models, and both good and bad decisions. He can look at CEOs, both present and past, and he can sift through balance sheets. Buffett has observed the strategies of their competitors and has seen how these companies navigate business cycles, both good and bad. To be clear, Buffett likes to invest in companies that are relatively new and have been the winners in the new world of tech. This includes, among others, Amazon and Apple. As he watched Apple stock tumble, he sold off some of those holdings. Buffett has lost money on some investments, but not enough to dent his overall spectacular returns.

      "title": "Nvidia (NVDA) Doesn’t Care About China Anymore",
      "content": "Key Points Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has reclaimed its position as the world’s most valuable company, with its stock up over 65% from April lows amid explosive AI infrastructure investment. Demand for AI server chips remains robust as tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ: META), and OpenAI are expected to invest upwards of $600 billion in data center infrastructure. Despite past concerns over China restrictions, Nvidia&#8217;s dominant 92% market share in AI GPUs and upward revenue guidance ($44B for the quarter) continue to sustain bullish momentum.

Again, it&#8217;s I think they&#8217;re up to 3.27 trillion. They passed Microsoft. Interesting. Does that count [00:00:17] Lee Jackson: how much their core weave is up? Yes. [00:00:21] Doug McIntyre: Yes. Now it did something else. And that is, their, Mr. [00:00:25] Doug McIntyre: Huang, their CEO Yes. Is now worth $135 billion. So he was helped out by that as well. Was he ever? Yeah, so I mean, this stock has rallied almost 40%. it hit that, tremendous low in March and it&#8217;s had a ridiculous rally since then. It&#8217;s up like [00:00:49] Lee Jackson: 66%. Yeah, it traded down to almost 90 didn&#8217;t it? [00:00:53] Lee Jackson: Back in April or the, at the very low. [00:00:56] Doug McIntyre: Well, and, at that point, the comment was, is that a big worry about the fact that there was $50 billion that they couldn&#8217;t get because they were being shut out of China by Trump. So I guess their earnings, plus all these announcements about, AI server farms, I think by my calculation, the amount of money in aggregate that&#8217;s going to be invested in AI server farms is about $600 billion. [00:01:27] Doug McIntyre: If you take Microsoft and Meta and OpenAI, what people have said they will spend to build these things. So I think it&#8217;s gonna be [00:01:35] Lee Jackson: more than that. The, place that,or Meta&#8217;s built building in Louisiana is like a whole county. [00:01:43] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. So let&#8217;s just say that&#8217;s the low end. But if you add all those things together. [00:01:49] Doug McIntyre: I think what you get is the impression that they&#8217;re not gonna have any trouble selling, chips at all. No, and listen, there, the one thing about their earnings is that they guided, to 44 billion for this quarter. Right. So that implies that they would be up in revenue another 60 or 70%, quarter over previously years quarter. [00:02:17] Doug McIntyre: and what that means is that their mon momentum stays, from a revenue standpoint, roughly the same. They&#8217;ve got 92% market share. Right now, AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) is second with about, I dunno, six. listen, all companies are stoppable at some point e every, everybody reaches a wall. [00:02:40] Lee Jackson: Yep, they will. They will, [00:02:42] Doug McIntyre: but they haven&#8217;t yet. [00:02:43] Doug McIntyre: So that&#8217;s why. Well, [00:02:45] Lee Jackson: and it, [00:02:46] Lee Jackson: doesn&#8217;t appear, especially based upon, to your point. The addition of all these server farms it&#8217;s everywhere. it&#8217;s all across the country. So yeah, the, I think they have, there&#8217;s some more tailwind to, this rally, but again, we&#8217;re getting near the end of literally a 20% bounce back. [00:03:07] Lee Jackson: So it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how it trades from here. [00:03:10] Doug McIntyre: Well, they&#8217;re also, I think, sort of being helped psychologically by the fact that all the other, with one or two exceptions, all the other big tech stocks have also bounced back. And since so many of them, the impression investors have is that all of these are AI proxies. [00:03:27] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. Yeah. in one way or another, everybody on the list, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), they&#8217;re all, listen Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), that Tesla is now an AI play in the minds of investors, and that&#8217;s why market cap is so much higher than the other car companies. So Nvidia has benefited from two things. It looks like it&#8217;s in great shape and China doesn&#8217;t matter. [00:03:52] Doug McIntyre: And it looks like everybody else is in great shape who wants to be in this business and the people in the private capital is still going into these companies. Yeah, [00:04:05] Lee Jackson: I haven&#8217;t seen a stock like this since the nineties, so I really haven&#8217;t that I can, at least I can think of. I mean, back when everybody would wait for Intel&#8217;s (NASDAQ: INTC) numbers or everybody would wait for Microsoft Numbers or some microsystems or whatever back then, but I haven&#8217;t seen anything like this in a very long time. [00:04:24] Lee Jackson: Yeah. [00:04:26] Doug McIntyre: I&#8217;m gonna say that I think that it still has room to run. I mean, I know that it&#8217;s up by really a ludicrous percentage amount. It&#8217;s at a high, the market cap, 65% off that April low, but I, there&#8217;s no news that&#8217;s gonna stop this until earnings. The China thing is baked. China&#8217;s baked in, right? [00:04:49] Doug McIntyre: Good earnings are baked in. Every time there&#8217;s another, a server farm announcement, nobody&#8217;s surprised. It&#8217;s if you said to me that, OpenAI was gonna open a server farm in Canada and they were gonna spend, a hundred billion dollars, like, okay, sure. that&#8217;s par for the course. [00:05:08] Doug McIntyre: I&#8217;m not surprised at all. So [00:05:10] Lee Jackson: yeah, it&#8217;s really become so, and it&#8217;s interesting though, even though technology has led this big bounce, four of the Mag seven, I think we&#8217;re still down a week ago. I mean, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was down, Tesla was down and, for this year, and I was kind of surprised when I saw that, but boy, it, has been a just a ripped the shorts head off kind of rally that I haven&#8217;t seen in years. [00:05:36] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. So, that takes along with it, the markets are basically at an all time high. Yeah. And so, no surprising, you&#8217;ve got some of these big cap companies, they&#8217;re leading the rally as has happened, the last leg up on this before you had some sell down. It&#8217;s the same companies leading this rally up, so. [00:06:01] Doug McIntyre: Yep, yep. I mean, that&#8217;s the news in this segment. You&#8217;ve got, Wong becoming one of the richest people in the world. You&#8217;ve got the market cap up and you&#8217;ve got all the reasons why it is up, so. [00:06:13] Lee Jackson: yep. And, it&#8217;s the old don&#8217;t want to be the last one in the door versus don&#8217;t wanna not have it in your portfolio if you&#8217;re a pm, Yeah. So it&#8217;s, like you&#8217;re, caught between a rock and a hard place here. [00:06:26] The post Nvidia (NVDA) Doesn&#8217;t Care About China Anymore appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

He has a net worth of $164 billion, below that of his former boss Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, at $177 billion. Ballmer left the CEO’s job at Microsoft in 2013. He wisely did not sell most of his shares when he left the company. He owns 4% of the massive tech company, which makes him Microsoft&#8217;s largest private owner. His dividends alone make him $1 billion a year. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Former Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) CEO Steve Ballmer is the sixth richest person in the world. Those on the list above him all founded huge tech companies. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The people on the list above Ballmer all started huge tech companies. These include Tesla&#8217;s Elon Musk at $368 billion, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg at $241 billion, Oracle’s Larry Ellison at $234 billion, and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos at $233 billion. Ballmer joined Microsoft in 1980 and became chief executive in 2000. During his 14-year tenure, Microsoft’s revenue tripled. As Ballmer left, Eric Jackson at the hedge fund Ironfire Capital told Reuters, “I don’t see anybody else on the management team at Microsoft that I think would be much better than Ballmer.” However, he received criticism for not launching popular products like the rival Steve Jobs did at Apple. Ballmer kept 333 million shares despite leaving, about triple the number Gates has kept. Ballmer has become a major philanthropist. While not as visible as Gates and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, according to Forbes, “He has ramped up his philanthropy since 2014; to date the Ballmers have given away more than $4 billion.” Microsoft Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 The post The World&#8217;s Richest Don&#8217;t Have to Be Tech Founders, Look at Steve Ballmer appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

      "content": "Close Apple (AAPL) could turn to ChatGPT maker OpenAI or Anthropic for help after delays in the launch of its highly anticipated AI-enhanced Siri, Bloomberg reported Monday. The iPhone maker has held talks with both Anthropic and OpenAI about relying on their AI models instead of in-house technology, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. Siri can be used to access ChatGPT with some iPhone models. Significant delays have raised pressure on Apple to prove it can compete with other tech leaders on AI development. Anthropic declined to comment on the report. Apple and OpenAI did not respond to an Investopedia request for comment in time for publication. At Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference earlier this month, Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said the Siri features “need more time to reach our high quality bar” and that more information would be released “in the coming year.” Shares of Apple rose 2% to close just above $205 on Monday. The stock has lost nearly a fifth of its value in 2025 so far, making it the second-worst-performing member of the Magnificent Seven stocks this year after Tesla (TSLA).
