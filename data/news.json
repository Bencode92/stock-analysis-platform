      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended So Close and Yet so Far 4:09 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices both crossed over into record territory during today&#8217;s trading session but they came off those lofty levels by the market closing. The Nasdaq Composite still closed up about 1% to 20,167.91 while the S&amp;P 500 index finished the day 0.80% higher at 6,141.02. Big Tech Downgrade 12:55 pm by Gerelyn Terzo While Tesla stock received a ringing endorsement from Wall Street analysts today, Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is seeing the other side of the spectrum. JPMorgan analysts lowered their price target on the iPhone maker to $230 from $240, keeping their &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on the stock. The analysts are worried about demand for the iPhone 17. Apple shares are lower by 0.79% today. The Nasdaq Composite is now up 0.70%. Benchmark Bullish on TSLA 11:01 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street research firm Benchmark is bullish on EV leader Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). The firm believes TSLA stock has runway for 45% gains as a result of its competitive edge over rival robotaxi company Waymo. Benchmark lifted its price target on Tesla stock by a massive $125 to $450 per share. Tesla stock is up 0.39% today and is down 18.7% year-to-date. Wall Street Calls 10:00 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street analysts are making some calls on the following stocks this morning: KeyBanc has started coverage of networking giant Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO) with an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating, saying the stock has plenty of runway for growth. Baird analysts are bullish on health stock Haemonetics (NYSE: HAE), beginning coverage with an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating. UBS has reiterated its &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating on Apple (Nasdaq: APPL) stock, citing risks surrounding a potential deal with AI giant Perplexity. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are showing off as stocks come within grasp of their latest all-time high levels. With the strikes between Israel and Iran seemingly behind, the markets have reason for optimism and they are taking it. All three of the major stock market averages are in the green out of the gate, including a 0.40% advance in the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite. The S&amp;P 500 is eyeing its latest all-time high of 2025, which is in the ballpark of 6,147, its early 2025 intraday high level. After Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) clinched a new record high of approximately $156 per share, bullish sentiment has enveloped technology stocks for the most part. On the economic front, the economy slowed at a steeper pace than originally expected in Q1 2025. U.S. GDP declined by 0.5% in Q1 compared to original estimates of a 0.2% contraction. As the data continues to flow in, the Commerce Department downwardly revised results in areas such as consumer spending and exports. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 121.40 (+0.37%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 87.92 (+0.40%) S&amp;P 500: Up 21.43 (+0.39%) Market Movers AeroVironment (Nasdaq: AVAV) is gaining 9.2% today, extending its rally after posting impressive Q4 results that were powered by robust military drone demand, fueling a 40% increase in revenue. BP (NYSE: BP) is under pressure today amid reports that it is a takeover target involving industry giant Shell, rumors BP rebuffed. Micron Technology (Nasdaq: MU) is down slightly on the heels of its strong Q3 results, including better-than-expected profits and a positive outlook for the current quarter.

      "title": "My Top 3 ETF’s I Would Put $10,000 In Today",
      "content": "Key Points Looking for high-yield ETFs? These three popular ETFs will never disappoint you. Each ETF is highly diversified, low-cost, low risk and pays steady dividends. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Market volatility in 2025 has driven investors towards safer assets like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). By investing in ETFs, you not only build a highly diversified portfolio but also generate steady income and hold some of the top companies. You do not have to pick individual stocks to make money. ETFs are a low-cost option of investing in stocks and they reduce company-specific risks. If you’re looking for the best ETFs to invest in this year, I’ve identified 3 where I’d put my $10,000 today. Since no two funds are equal, you need to weigh each based on your personal financial goals and risk appetite. JP Morgan Equity Premium ETF The J.P. Morgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI) is a covered call ETF that invests in the top S&amp;P 500 stocks. These stocks are known for little risk and steady returns. It offers a monthly payout and invests in the top U.S. blue-chip companies. The ETF enjoys an attractive 30-day SEC yield of 11.38% and holds 126 stocks. Since it is a covered call ETF, the fund buys stocks and then sells call options on them, this gives the buyers a chance to make a profit. While investors get a share in some profits, most are drawn to the high dividend yield. JEPI has an expense ratio of 0.35% and its NAV is $56.04. The ETF has remained flat in the year but the dividend yield makes it worth a consideration. Since it owns elite names and holds dividend-paying companies, it ensures a steady income for investors. Its holdings include: Information Technology: 15.8% Financials: 13% Industrials: 12.8% Healthcare: 11.3% The ETF also owns some of the Magnificent Seven, namely, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla. None of the stocks have a weightage higher than 2%. Despite investing the majority of the funds in the tech sector, JEPI reduces the sector-specific risks with its highly diversified portfolio. Even if the ETF moves sideways in the short term, investors can benefit from the steady passive income. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF If you are looking for a fund that is not tech-heavy, the Schwab U.S. Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD) is a smart choice. The fund offers the potential for income and growth. It holds 103 stocks and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 index. It has an expense ratio of 0.06% and a 30-day SEC yield of 3.81%. While the ETF has a slightly lower dividend yield, it offers capital appreciation. The NAV of the fund is $26.90 and it is up 4.38% in 12 months and over 50% in five years. The fund holdings include: Energy: 21.08% Consumer staples: 19.06% Healthcare: 15.68% Industrials: 12.45% None of the stocks in the ETF have a weightage higher than 5% and the top holdings include popular names like Cisco, ConocoPhillips, Texas Instruments, Coca-Cola, and Chevron Corporation. These are some of the dividend-paying companies. If you’re a passive income investor looking for a low-risk investment option, SCHD is a great choice. The ETF offers a wide range of top-quality dividend stocks to help build your passive income portfolio. SCHD isn’t tech-heavy, meaning you do not have to worry about your returns during volatility. The highly diversified portfolio owns elite names and pay quarterly dividends. JP Morgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF The JP Morgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ: JEPQ) invests in the Nasdaq 100 and holds stocks that have little volatility. It holds 108 stocks and has a 30-day SEC yield of 14.47%. JEPQ has an expense ratio of 0.35% and focuses heavily on tech. The fund holdings include: Information technology: 42.4% Other: 16.5% Communication services: 12.9% Consumer discretionary: 12.1% I believe that the future is tech and by investing in JEPQ, it is possible to reduce the company-specific risks while holding the top tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft. The top 10 stocks in the fund form 44.34% of the portfolio and these are tech companies except for Costco. The tech sector has rallied in the past and once the economy improves, we could see it pick pace again. JEPQ has an NAV of $52.59 and is down 4.87% in 12 months. Since the fund focuses on high yield, the capital appreciation could be limited. However, I believe the fund has the potential to keep rewarding investors with a solid yield. JEPI and JEPQ both have a solid dividend yield and the fund is handled by the experts at JP Morgan, making it low-risk and highly reliable. JEPQ pays monthly dividends and offers a balanced portfolio of elite heavyweights. The low-stress ETF is one of the best placess to invest $10,000 today.

      "title": "Jim Cramer Is Fixated On An International Rotation",
      "content": "One of the world’s most prolific talking heads around the stock market, Jim Cramer needs little introduction in the financial world. The host of MAD MONEY on CNBC, Cramer, has been in the investing and media game for years, and for the most part, he’s got his pulse on the market better than most. Key Points Jim Cramer is taking a long, hard look at some European names that have been overlooked. His take is that Europe has been overlooked for too long, and some major brands are experiencing financial growth in the region. Camer wholeheartedly believes that ignoring Europe would mean ignoring financial gains. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) A continent with nearly 750 million people, Cramer believes this region of the world has been overlooked for far too long. Indicating that this region is on the rise, his take is that the state of Europe is very strong, something heavyweight giants like the CEO of Cisco support wholeheartedly. Europe Is Coming Back There is no question that Cramer, who believes Wall Street has overlooked Europe unnecessarily, is fixated on the region&#8217;s sudden rise and the belief that a host of companies are experiencing significant success. Cramer notes that there has been an increase in spending, particularly in the technology sector, across Europe. He highlights that even the telecom companies, which have generally been adverse to big spending in the region, are now opening up their wallets in a meaningful and impactful way. His concern is that Wall Street has ignored Europe for far too long. Still, Portugal, Italy, Spain, and numerous other countries in the European region are now directly on Cramer’s radar. Amazon (AMZN) When it comes to Amazon, Cramer specifically highlights that the company has been losing money in Europe for as long as he can remember. Now, the company has turned the corner, showing at least one billion in profit in the last quarter alone, just from European sales. He also thinks that the stock is on the rise, specifically because investors are seeing the growth potential in Europe. According to online research, Amazon has a market penetration of at least 64% in Germany and approximately 50% of the online market in Spain. This is before you turn your attention to France, where 35% of the spending shoppers do online goes to Amazon. In Italy, nearly 70% of all online spending is directed to Amazon, which further supports Jim’s point that Amazon is a must-watch stock in Europe. Apple (AAPL) When you consider that Apple saw a 10% increase in iPhone shipments in Europe in the first quarter of 2025, despite a worldwide decline, it’s another reason in favor of Cramer’s outlook on the company. This led to almost a billion dollars in profit for the first quarter, similar to Amazon&#8217;s, just in Europe. Cramer indicates that nobody saw this coming, and yet, it’s a telling sign that Apple is seeing these kinds of numbers in the market. Burberry (BURBY) Burberry, headquartered in London, recently announced that it was laying off 20% of its global workforce, but this didn’t stop its stock from jumping in response. On June 25, 2025, the company highlighted that Q1 sales were proof that its resilience in the market was no fluke. It also expects the first quarter of its 2026 financial year to outperform the fourth quarter of 2025, which boosts Cramer&#8217;s argument about these specific companies. Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) European telecom giant Deutsche Telekom is also back on the rise, especially in light of its recent signing a deal with NVIDIA to establish an AI cloud for European manufacturers in Germany. NVIDIA said it will supply at least 10,000 chips to be used in Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s data centers, which is a win for both companies and demonstrates that DT is no longer hesitant to invest significantly. Cramer specifically highlights this willingness to open its wallet as a reason to keep an eye on this stock. ASML (ASML) Another company on Cramer’s radar is ASML, a Dutch multinational corporation specializing in the semiconductor industry, which is poised for significant financial growth. The company is standing by its reduced forecast from a month ago, but Cramer doesn’t think anyone is properly paying attention to the stock. He says this is one to watch.

      "title": "QQQI vs. JEPQ: Which ETF is the True Dividend King?",
      "content": "Key Points The NASDAQ-100 is a volatile index that offers considerable long term upside amidst its intraday turbulence. Use of financial derivatives for both risk mitigation and for potentially larger leveraged gains has become routine in the financial world, especially for QQQI and JEPQ. To qualify as a “Dividend King”, a stock must have a track record of 50 or more consecutive years of dividend increases due to the underlying issuing company’s intrinsic growth. ETF “dividend kings” are metaphorical, but may reference a head to head comparison. Are you ahead or behind on your retirement goals?

Don’t waste another minute – get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Seven of the top largest S&amp;P 500 stocks by market cap are tech industry companies that have been dubbed “The Magnificent 7” due to their remarkable tandem bull run over the past several years. These stocks are:: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Meta Platforms (Facebook), Nvidia, and Tesla. In order to give better focus on the tech and other higher growth sectors, which tend to be listed on NASDAQ, the NASDAQ-100 index was created to track the top 100 NASDAQ listed companies that are not in the financial sector, as the tech emphasis also purports to emphasize innovation and new products instead of financial companies, which ostensibly do not. The launch of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that track the NASDAQ-100 index was a foregone conclusion, and several of them already vie for investor dollars on a daily basis. Two that have exhibited sizable growth but have been able to augment their gains in the form of dividends, are: The NEOS Nasdaq-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ: QQQI), and the JP Morgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ: JEPQ). Ironically, both indexes generate their high yields through strategic innovations that rival those in the tech sector, in terms of their potential to deliver performance enhancements for their assigned tasks. How QQQI and JEPQ Compare &#8211; An Overview Both QQQI and JEPQ track the NASDAQ 1oo ETF, which is very volatile, due to its heavy weighting in the technology sector. Both ETFs are still relatively young. QQQI only launched in January, 2024 and JEPQ began in May, 2022. The following details are based on market price at the time of this writing: Category QQQI JEPQ Yield 14.55% 11.28% Net Assets $1.76 billion $26.27 billion Average Daily Volume 970,269 shares 7.29 million shares Expense Ratio 0.68% 0.35% Beta 0.00 0.83 52-week range 41.17-54.47 44.31-58.54 1-year return 14.37% 7.69% 1-year trailing return 15.24% 8.49% 3-year return n/a 14.40% Largest Hedge Fund Holder Second Half Financial Ptnrs Fisher Asset Mgmt.

Both JEPQ and QQQI utilize option strategies to artificially create dividends for their shareholders. However there are both mechanical and risk/reward differences in their respective approaches. JEPQ uses Equity Linked Notes (ELNs), which are synthetic financial products created by financial institutions, and are linked to a particular index or stock. ELNs usually have a call option attached to a principal protection component, and can be likened to a short-term zero-coupon bond with a maturity of no longer than a few months. The returns on the ELN are linked to the underlying index or stock. Additionally, most, if not all ELNs are purchased directly from the issuer and held to maturity. There is no secondary market for ELNs. JEPQ manager Hamilton Reiner staggers one-month calls into multiple weekly buckets, then diversifies the expiration dates and strike prices. However, Reiner conducts this strategy with purchases of ELNs that give the JEPQ exposure to the profits on those call options, without the risk of any of the top tech stock holdings being subject to calls if the market takes off and the calls go in-the-money. Conversely, QQQI also utilizes a covered call strategy, in addition to out of the money call purchases to augment upside gains. QQQI writes their covered calls directly against the NASDAQ-100 index up to 100% of the equity value of total QQQI holdings. The fund then uses a portion of their covered call premium income to purchase out of the money call options. This give it the following result scenarios: If the market ends relatively flat, QQQI has kept the premium income minus the cost of the out of the money options. If the market jumps up, the underwritten covered call is already hedged against stocks, but QQQI can take profit on the out of the money call that ostensibly would be in the money due to the jump. Overall Analysis and The King of the Hill In This Competition For 1 year&#8217;s yield comparison, QQQI wins the &#8220;King of the Hill&#8221; contest against JEPQ, but has 49 years to go of upping the yield ante annually before being able to claim a &#8220;Dividend King&#8221; title. Selling covered calls is considered a viable strategy to mitigate volatility and take advantage of market volatility, which usually means increased delta and subsequently larger premiums. However, there is a reason why there is a sizable enough market on the buy side &#8211; there are enough people who think the option will increase in value. However, selling calls can limit interim upside, especially if the goal is for the option to expire worthless so the same underlying securities can cover another call writing opportunity next month. President Thomas Jefferson was once quoted, “ With risk comes great reward.” QQQI’s superior yield is a testament to the reward from being more aggressive and taking on more risk than JEPQ. However, with only slightly over 1 years’ worth of trading history and returns from which to judge, QQQI may be the dividend “king of the hill” only for the moment. Whether a consistent track record can be built or not on the QQQI strategy model, which needs to be actively managed by their presumably disciplined managers, remains to be seen. Since both companies’ dividends are artificially created through trading against market volatility, as opposed to intrinsic enhanced value through a business, the ability for JEPQ and QQQI rests solely on skill and knowledge of its managers. If they can first reach Dividend Aristocrat status (25 or more years of consecutive, annual dividend increases), then perhaps a hypothetical Dividend King discussion (50 consecutive years or more of dividend increases) can be had.

      "content": "Key Points As US tariffs hit, China&#8217;s manufacturing sector feels the bite Geopolitics began the slide, many multinationals have been looking for a new low cost country/region Risks are still present, but India&#8217;s advancements over the past 30 years have them well positioned Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset&#8217;s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don&#8217;t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) A seismic shift has transformed global manufacturing in recent years, with US and EU companies increasingly moving production from China to India. Accelerated by President Trump’s use of tariffs as trade weapons, this movement began a few years ago as geopolitical tensions and economic pressures began to raise concerns about supply chain resilience. India’s proactive policies have served to drive this trend toward supply chain diversification. While India has made remarkable progress over the past three decades, and holds vast potential as a manufacturing hub, infrastructure gaps and regulatory complexities present challenges. The primary driver is escalating friction with China. U.S.-China trade wars have imposed steep tariffs on Chinese goods, pushing companies to seek alternatives. From 2018 to 2022, U.S. goods imports from China dropped 10% (inflation-adjusted), while imports from India soared 44%, per trade data. Concerns over intellectual property theft and supply chain risks exposed during COVID-19 further fueled this shift. China’s rising labor and production costs have also eroded its edge in labor-intensive sectors like textiles and electronics, prompting companies to explore cost-competitive alternatives. India has emerged as a prime destination, propelled by initiatives like “Make in India” and Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes. These offer tax breaks (e.g., a 17% corporate tax rate for new manufacturing firms), subsidies to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), and a stable legal system rooted in British common law, safeguarding intellectual property. India’s youthful workforce (median age 28) and 1.4 billion-strong consumer market enhance its appeal. Apple, for example, has ramped up iPhone production in India, with Foxconn investing $1.5 billion in Tamil Nadu to supply the U.S. market. India’s share of Apple’s iPhone output grew from 2% to 5% between 2021 and 2022, with goals to hit 25%. Other giants like Dell, Nike, Intel, and Nippon Steel are also shifting production, with over 90% of North American manufacturers surveyed by BCG reporting some relocation from China in the past five years. Yet despite India’s appeal, challenges do remain. India’s infrastructure lags, with only 5% of roads classified as highways, causing logistical bottlenecks. Regulatory red tape hinders operations, with just 55% of companies reporting seamless production shifts. Manufacturing costs in India can also run 5–10% higher than in China due to import duties on components. India faces competition from Vietnam, a leader in electronics, and Mexico, advantaged by its proximity to the U.S. Companies and investors must navigate these hurdles to ensure profitability. This shift opens doors for entrepreneurs and businesses. Investors can target Indian firms or ETFs in booming sectors like electronics and semiconductors, which attracted $16 billion in manufacturing FDI from 2020 to 2023. Content creators can monetize blogs or videos on India’s manufacturing surge through ads or sponsorships. Consulting services offer another path, providing market research or regulatory guidance for firms entering India. Businesses can also develop logistics or compliance solutions to address operational challenges. The pivot from China to India reflects geopolitical, economic, and logistical realities. India’s policies and demographic strengths position it as a rising manufacturing powerhouse, but infrastructure and regulatory hurdles require careful strategy. Opportunities in investment, content creation, and consulting abound for those who can navigate India’s complexities with precision. Investors can explore top Indian companies listed on U.S. exchanges, such as HDFC Bank (NYSE: HDB), Infosys (NYSE: INFY), or MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ: MMYT). For broader exposure, the iShares MSCI India ETF (NASDAQ: INDA) tracks the MSCI India Index, covering roughly 85% of India’s large and mid-cap equity market.

      "title": "Jim Cramer: ‘Trump Discount’ Is Hurting Markets",
      "content": "Key Points in This Article: CNBC’s Mad Money host Jim Cramer is often criticized for inaccurate stock picks that inspire routine bets against his calls as a better way to beat the market. Due to his unreliable predictions and over-the-top policy complaints, investors would be better served by focusing on company fundamentals. Nvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of &#8216;Next Nvidia Stocks&#8217; that could be even better. Click here to learn more. A Controversial Track Record Jim Cramer is a polarizing figure in financial media, known for hosting CNBC’s Mad Money and co-anchoring Squawk on the Street. A Harvard-educated former hedge fund manager, Cramer’s high-energy stock picks and market commentary have made him a household name among retail investors. However, his predictions are frequently criticized for their inconsistency, with many noting he’s often wrong about his stock calls. This reputation led to the creation of the Inverse Cramer ETF, which aimed to profit by betting against his recommendations. Although the ETF shut down due to lack of interest, an X account named “Inverse Cramer” continues to mock his calls, highlighting his spotty track record. Cramer’s bold, sometimes erratic takes &#8212; such a a recent essay he wrote on a so-called “Trump discount” &#8212; often spark debate, with critics pointing to his tendency to overemphasize short-term noise over long-term fundamentals, making his advice a risky bet for investors. Cramer’s “Trump Discount” Thesis In his June 1 article, Jim Cramer argues that a “Trump discount” is suppressing U.S. stock market performance due to the unpredictability of President Trump’s policies. He contrasts Europe’s “consistency of mediocrity” with U.S. volatility, claiming the White House’s immense power creates instability. Cramer cites examples across sectors: Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) gains were short-lived due to policy uncertainty; retail stocks like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) face tariff-related confusion; drug companies suffer from shifting Medicare pricing policies and vaccine skepticism; food companies like Campbell’s (NYSE:CPB) face regulatory pressure from RFK Jr.; Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) struggles with Trump’s push for U.S.-only manufacturing; software and internet giants like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) face unexpected scrutiny; banks see no regulatory relief; mergers and acquisitions are stalled by unpredictable cash flows; and energy stocks, despite Trump’s pro-drilling stance, lack momentum due to high costs and regulatory hurdles. Cramer predicts continued market declines, noting a recent 1% S&amp;P 500 drop, exacerbated by mixed signals about U.S.-China trade talks. Flaws in Cramer’s Argument Cramer’s thesis appears flawed for several reasons. First, his “Trump discount” overstates the impact of presidential policies on broad market performance. The S&amp;P 500, far from being discounted, has gained since he wrote his article, and is near record highs, contradicting his bearish outlook. Second, his sector-specific arguments lack depth. Nvidia’s volatility is more tied to market cycles and competition than Trump’s policies. Retailers like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and TJX (NYSE:TJX) have thrived despite tariff fears, with Costco’s stock rising due to strong fundamentals, not a “Trump premium.” Third, Cramer’s focus on short-term policy noise ignores long-term drivers like corporate earnings and consumer demand. His concerns about drug stocks, which he ties to RFK Jr.’s influence, overstate the impact of unconfirmed regulatory changes, since Medicare negotiation frameworks remain complex and slow-moving. Similarly, his critique of Apple misinterprets global supply chain dynamics; India’s manufacturing shift is a strategic diversification, not a policy misstep. Cramer’s Track Record and Market Misreads Cramer’s historical inaccuracy fuels skepticism. The Inverse Cramer ETF, though defunct, capitalized on his poor track record, and the ongoing X account highlights his frequent misses. His alarmist tone, comparing Trump’s influence to Andrew Jackson’s era, exaggerates political impact while downplaying market resilience. For instance, energy stocks’ stagnation is less about Trump’s policies and more about global oil prices and ESG pressures, which Cramer barely addresses. His claim that Europe’s markets outperform due to “consistency” ignores their own challenges, like Germany’s 2025 economic slowdown. By fixating on sensationalized policy risks, Cramer overlooks broader market trends, such as technology-driven gains and robust consumer spending, which have propelled the S&amp;P 500 upward. Key Takeaways As always, focus on fundamentals, not noise. Investors should tune out sky-is-falling narratives like Cramer’s, which amplify short-term concerns over fundamentals. However, blind optimism about endless market gains is equally misguided. Markets naturally rise and fall, influenced by policies but driven by earnings, innovation, and economic cycles. While presidential actions, like tariffs or deregulation, can create volatility, they don’t dictate long-term outcomes. Investors would do well to focus on business fundamentals &#8212; revenue growth, profit margins, and competitive advantages &#8212; rather than reacting to pundits like Cramer. Consistent, long-term investing, diversified across sectors, remains the most reliable path to wealth creation, regardless of political headlines.

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Apple in Crosshairs 2:11 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock has a target on its back. Wall Street firm Needham has downgraded shares of the Big Tech stock to &#8220;hold&#8221; from &#8220;buy,&#8221; arguing the stock is hovering at frothy levels. Needham also pulled its $225 price target, noting a $170-$180 range would be an acceptable entry point. Apple shares were largely unchanged today, while the SPY ETF is up 0.26%. Citi Takes Aim at CEG 11:35 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street analyst firm Citi has reduced its rating on Constellation Energy (NYSE: CEG) shares in response to the utility&#8217;s long-term power agreement with Mag 7 stock Meta (Nasdaq: META). Analysts at Citi now classify CEG stock as high-risk, arguing that the company will forgo the opportunity for premium pricing on its nuclear-generated electricity. They have set a price target of $318. CEG shares are falling 3% today after yesterday&#8217;s rock-star performance. The SPY ETF is up 0.16% as of mid-morning trading. S&amp;P Outlook Looking Up 10:05 am by Gerelyn Terzo With the first half of 2025 almost behind us, Wall Street analysts are actively revising their year-end market forecasts. Most recently, Barclays has adjusted its S&amp;P 500 year-end outlook upward by nearly 3% to 6,050, a notable increase from its previous target of 5,900. Beyond Barclays, other prominent analyst firms like Deutsche Bank and RBC have also recently elevated their 2025 S&amp;P 500 targets, signaling a positively shifting consensus for the broader market&#8217;s direction. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Market optimism is overriding underwhelming labor market data, with all three major stock averages climbing higher as of morning trading. Yesterday, equities staged a turnaround, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its fourth consecutive winning session, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 also advanced. Today, most economic sectors are in positive territory, with technology leading the charge with a 1.48% gain. The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) is up 0.11%) Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) has surpassed Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) to reclaim its position as the world&#8217;s most valuable company, now boasting a market capitalization of $3.45 trillion. Traders and investors are betting whether NVDA stock can clinch new highs soon. Private Payrolls Slow, Sparking Rate Cut Calls Private sector hiring lost significant momentum in May, with payrolls expanding by a mere 37,000 jobs. These results not only fell short of April&#8217;s 60,000 gain but also missed the Dow Jones forecast of 110,000 by a wide margin. In a sobering sign for the labor market, it marked the lowest monthly job creation from the ADP report in over two years. Meanwhile, the picture for wages remained largely static compared with the prior month&#8217;s results. Following this weaker-than-expected private sector jobs data, President Trump is increasing pressure on Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, asserting that the Fed chairman should have already taken this action. Discount Retailers Rally, ON Semi Recovers Dollar General (NYSE: DG) is racing ahead by 15.8% today, extending yesterday&#8217;s gains on the back of a positive full-year outlook. Fellow discount retailer Dollar Tree (NYSE: DLTR) is also gaining 6% today, buoyed by similarly upbeat guidance. ON Semi (Nasdaq: ON) is climbing 2.7% today, recouping some recently lost ground. This comes after Morgan Stanley analysts recently indicated that much of the negative sentiment is already factored into ON&#8217;s stock price.

Sour Apple 2:05 pm by Gerelyn Terzo One Wall Street analyst firm is taking aim at Big Tech stock Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL). Needham analysts believe AAPL shares are too frothy, downgrading shares to &#8220;hold&#8221; from &#8220;buy.&#8221; The analyst firm also withdrew its price target of $225 per share, saying that the $170-$180 range reflects a more reasonable entry point.

Citi Downgrades This Nuclear Stock 11:30 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street firm Citi has downgraded shares of Constellation Energy (NYSE: CEG) on the heels of the utility&#8217;s long-term power arrangement with Big Tech company Meta (Nasdaq: META). Citi analysts attached a high-risk label to CEG stock, saying that it will miss out on premium pricing for its nuclear power, with a price target of $318.

Wall Street Improves Market Outlook 9:51 am by Gerelyn Terzo With the first half of 2025 nearly in the rearview mirror, Wall Street analysts are coming out in droves to revise their year-end forecasts. Most recently, Barclays has updated its S&amp;P 500 year-end outlook by close to 3% to 6,050 compared with a previous target of below 6,000. In addition to Barclays, other analysts firms that have lifted their 2025 S&amp;P 500 targets of late include Deutsche Bank and RBC.

      "content": "A recent list of Warren Buffett’s best quotes includes his primary view of investing. It represents sound advice that is as good as that provided by any seasoned investor: &#8220;The first rule of an investment is don&#8217;t lose (money). And the second rule of an investment is don&#8217;t forget the first rule. And that&#8217;s all the rules there are.&#8221; 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: One of Warren Buffett’s best pieces of investment advice is not to lose money. He may have lost money on some investments, but not enough to offset his overall spectacular returns. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) A $100 investment in his flagship company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B), which he took over in 1965, was worth $5.5 million at the end of last year. Some of this growth is due to financial companies that he favors and has acquired. This includes insurance company GEICO and several reinsurance companies. However, the largest private corporation he owns is the massive railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe Company. Two investments demonstrate the diversification of Buffett’s holdings. One is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) (some of which he sold off recently), and the other is the Chinese EV company BYD. He purchased many of his BYD shares in 2008 when the company was still an obscure carmaker. That investment of $230 million is worth $2.4 billion. BYD sells more EVs than Tesla does. Some of his investments are in America’s oldest companies. These are also some of America’s valuable and visible brands. Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) was launched in 1886. Berkshire Hathaway was a significant company before Buffett took over in 1965. Kroger Inc. (NYSE: KR) was founded in 1883. American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) got its start in 1850. All were part of Buffett’s holdings in the first quarter of 2025. He has held some of these for most of this century. These represent part of his investment rules and philosophies. Often among the best investments are companies that have been industry giants and successful since before Buffett was born in 1930. He and his staff can examine earnings, business models, and both good and bad decisions. He can look at CEOs, both present and past, and he can sift through balance sheets. Buffett has observed the strategies of their competitors and has seen how these companies navigate business cycles, both good and bad. To be clear, Buffett likes to invest in companies that are relatively new and have been the winners in the new world of tech. This includes, among others, Amazon and Apple. As he watched Apple stock tumble, he sold off some of those holdings. Buffett has lost money on some investments, but not enough to dent his overall spectacular returns.

      "content": "Preliminary findings in tech research firm Counterpoint’s Market Pulse Global Monthly Smartphone Sales Report are that iPhone sales were extremely strong. According to the report, “iPhone sales grew a healthy 15% YoY in April and May, first two months of Q2 2025. This is Apple’s highest market share for these two months combined post pandemic.” 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone sales have been strong in recent months. Expected price increases due to tariffs are one reason for the increased demand. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has posted sales declines in this period for three years. The reversal of the trend was largely due to the United States and China. “Both US and China returned to positive YoY growth after three years of declines in this less seasonal period,” the authors wrote. There are probably two reasons for the jump. One is that U.S. consumers want to buy an iPhone before tariffs as high as 25% raise prices. The other is that Apple has offered “attractive” prices in China. Counterpoint also noted that iPhone sales in Japan had risen. Demand for the new iPhone 16e, a compact version of the product, triggered the increase. Sales in India have also risen. That market has changed, according to the report: “The iPhone is the most aspirational tech product for tech-savvy consumers here.” The news is particularly good because Samsung, Apple’s greatest global smartphone competition, has introduced new foldable phones. Moreover, Apple has had some success in China, where local companies such as Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo have strong footholds. Apple’s iPhone sales remain constrained because it has not launched the advanced artificial intelligence (AI) product it said would be part of its new iOS. The company says this will not be released until next year. This has disappointed some consumers and affected demand. While consumers worldwide cannot evaluate Apple’s new AI today, it has not undermined sales as much as some experts who follow the company thought it would. Why Is No One Talking About Apple’s Long-Term Artificial Intelligence Plans? The post Recent iPhone Sales Soar appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

He has a net worth of $164 billion, below that of his former boss Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, at $177 billion. Ballmer left the CEO’s job at Microsoft in 2013. He wisely did not sell most of his shares when he left the company. He owns 4% of the massive tech company, which makes him Microsoft&#8217;s largest private owner. His dividends alone make him $1 billion a year. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Former Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) CEO Steve Ballmer is the sixth richest person in the world. Those on the list above him all founded huge tech companies. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The people on the list above Ballmer all started huge tech companies. These include Tesla&#8217;s Elon Musk at $368 billion, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg at $241 billion, Oracle’s Larry Ellison at $234 billion, and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos at $233 billion. Ballmer joined Microsoft in 1980 and became chief executive in 2000. During his 14-year tenure, Microsoft’s revenue tripled. As Ballmer left, Eric Jackson at the hedge fund Ironfire Capital told Reuters, “I don’t see anybody else on the management team at Microsoft that I think would be much better than Ballmer.” However, he received criticism for not launching popular products like the rival Steve Jobs did at Apple. Ballmer kept 333 million shares despite leaving, about triple the number Gates has kept. Ballmer has become a major philanthropist. While not as visible as Gates and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, according to Forbes, “He has ramped up his philanthropy since 2014; to date the Ballmers have given away more than $4 billion.” Microsoft Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 The post The World&#8217;s Richest Don&#8217;t Have to Be Tech Founders, Look at Steve Ballmer appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",
