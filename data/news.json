      "title": "France fines Apple €150 million over app tracking violations, EU probes follow",
      "content": "Apple has been hit with a €150 million ($162 million) fine by France’s competition authority over its App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, a move that adds pressure from multiple fronts as investigations in other EU countries gain traction. The penalty, announced on Monday, stems from how the iPhone maker rolled out the ATT feature, which critics argue undermines competition by limiting third-party advertising while boosting Apple’s own ad services.The fine reflects growing concern in the European Union about how dominant tech companies enforce privacy standards that may also act as commercial barriers. In Apple’s case, regulators found that ATT, introduced in 2021, unfairly impacted rival app developers and publishers by making user consent harder for third parties to obtain.ATT rollout triggers EU probesFrench regulators said Apple’s ATT rollout was neither necessary nor proportionate to the company’s stated goal of protecting user privacy. Although the tool asks users whether they want apps to track their activity across other apps and websites, the French Competition Authority found that the system was designed in a way that placed a heavier burden on third-party developers than on Apple itself.One major issue was the number of consent pop-ups users encountered. While third-party apps were required to display the ATT prompt, Apple’s own advertising services were integrated in a way that required less user effort to accept. Users had to opt out of ad tracking twice in Apple’s own settings, which the French watchdog said undermined the feature’s neutrality.Apple has also been ordered to publish the decision on its website for seven days, a standard measure in France for competition-related rulings.The French investigation originated from industry complaints filed in 2021. While emergency action was denied at the time, the regulator pursued a full-scale probe that has now led to financial penalties.Smaller publishers lose ad revenueIn its ruling, France’s authority emphasised the disproportionate economic impact ATT had on smaller app developers and ad service providers. These smaller players typically rely on third-party data collection for revenue generation through targeted advertising. Apple’s changes disrupted these practices, cutting off access to Apple&#8217;s Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) if users declined consent via the ATT prompt.This restriction effectively altered the dynamics of the mobile advertising market, where Apple&#8217;s rivals found themselves operating under stricter conditions. Apple, on the other hand, retained certain capabilities for its own ads within the App Store and other services.The competition body argued that ATT&#8217;s dual opt-out process placed unnecessary hurdles in front of users and made it more likely that they would remain in Apple&#8217;s ecosystem, giving the company an edge in the mobile ad space.Investigations spread to 4 countriesThe fine is part of broader scrutiny in Europe. Competition authorities in Germany, Italy, Romania, and Poland have each launched similar investigations into ATT, reflecting concerns that Apple may be favouring its own services in ways that violate local and EU-wide competition laws.These investigations focus not only on ATT’s technical implementation but also on the market power Apple holds through its control of iOS, the App Store, and user access to device-level data.While the French authority acted independently, any eventual findings from these additional countries could fuel coordinated EU action or raise the possibility of further fines and regulatory measures.Apple’s privacy tool under fireApple introduced ATT in April 2021 as part of iOS 14.5, presenting it as a privacy-focused feature aimed at giving users control over how apps track their online behaviour. The move was widely welcomed by privacy advocates, but triggered immediate backlash from advertisers and app developers.Since the rollout, Apple’s ad business has grown significantly, driven in part by increased reliance on the App Store’s native ad network. Critics argue that Apple’s design choices favour its own ecosystem while making it harder for competitors to maintain viable advertising models.Although the ATT framework technically applies to all apps, the French Competition Authority said Apple was not held to the same standard as others when it came to gaining user consent, thus violating the principle of fair access and harming competition.The post France fines Apple €150 million over app tracking violations, EU probes follow appeared first on Invezz",

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Markets Lose Their Mojo 4:00 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets finished the day much like they started it &#8211; lower. All three of the major stock market indexes were sent reeling today, including an eye-popping 4% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. Right behind it was the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with nearly another 1,000-point drop, and the S&amp;P 500, falling 3.3%. President Trump is willing to extend the 90-day tariff relief, but it did little to lift the market sentiment today. Meanwhile, the trade war with China is only becoming more intense, with Fox Business reporting that President Trump is looking to delist China-listed companies from the U.S. stock market. Here&#8217;s a look at today&#8217;s damage: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 964.73 (-2.38%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 698.15 (-4.08%) S&amp;P 500: Down 181.50 (-3.3%) Tariff Fears Return 1:36 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The Nasdaq Composite&#8217;s 5.8% drop is being fueled by declines in Big Tech, including Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), which are each down between 4% and 7% today. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 is barreling toward circuit breaker status in which trading on the NYSE is halted to prevent further panic selling. President Trump is speaking with Cabinet members today on Capitol Hill while a U.S./China trade war fuels selling. Every sector of the economy is showing red today, including a 6.7% drop in energy stocks. Apple Falls 6% 11:52 am by Gerelyn Terzo Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock is falling by over 6% in today&#8217;s trading action. The declines come on the heels of the day in which it experienced its best trading day in nearly three decades. The broader market selling has intensified, sending the Nasdaq Composite spiraling by about 5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower by 3.4% and the S&amp;P 500 lower by 4.2%, erasing much of yesterday&#8217;s gains. Tariffs are easing while inflation is falling, but stocks are still spooked. Roller Coaster Ride 10:06 am by Gerelyn Terzo Stocks remain under pressure as of mid-morning trading, including a 3.2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite after yesterday&#8217;s historic performance. The easing tariffs have failed to lift market sentiment today. Used-car platform CarMax (NYSE: KMX) is falling 14% after a disappointing fiscal Q4 earnings print. Taiwan Semi (TSMC) is falling by 3%. Trump Media (Nasdaq: DJT) is falling 1%. U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) is falling by 7.3%. The markets opened in a sea of red on the heels of yesterday&#8217;s historic rally. Today these skittish markets are taking back some of those gains after investors followed President Trump&#8217;s advice to buy the dip. Despite tariff relief, all three of the major stock market averages went south, with Big Tech names dragging the Nasdaq Composite lower. Most sectors of the economy were under pressure in early trading, including declines of over 3% each in energy and tech. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) is down 3% this morning. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on CNBC that the current market environment could be a tailwind for acquisitions. He also believes sellers on the e-commerce platform would pass along tariff costs to consumers. The company continues to invest heavily in AI. The markets has the opportunity to shift their attention from tariffs to inflation this morning. In a dose of good news, the Labor Department&#8217;s latest inflation print came in cooler than expected, with consumer prices easing to 2.4% in the 12-month stretch leading up to March, compared with economists expectations of 2.6%. On a monthly basis, the CPI declined by 0.1% last month after climbing higher by 0.2% in February, a welcome shift. Historically, March inflation generally increases, with this year marking a notable shift in the trend. Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 706.27 (-1.74%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 478.08 (-2.7%) S&amp;P 500: Down 117.81 (-2.16%) Market Movers Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stock is off 5% today. The company has begun selling its EVs in Saudi Arabia where it is hoping to drive a social shift in the oil-rich Kingdom that is dependent on fossil-fueled powered vehicles. Cognizant Technology Solutions (Nasdaq: CTSH) is falling by 3% today after inking a partnership deal with OMRON&#8217;s automation business products. With a market cap of $34.8 billion, CTSH pays a dividend yield of 1.8%. Energy stocks are also under pressure, including Constellation Energy (Nasdaq: CEG), which is falling by 3.5% today. The stock is up over 10% in the past five days and is experiencing profit taking today though it remains above the $200 threshold.

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Markets Look Up 2:17 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street is determined to end the week on a positive note, as all three of the major stock market averages make their way decidedly into the green. The Nasdaq Composite is leading the charge with a 1.8% advance, followed by the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, which are up 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively. China is apparently ready to come to the negotiating table on tariffs, infusing optimism into an otherwise confused stock market today. The Nasdaq Composite is being led by stocks like Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) and Apple Materials (Nasdaq: AMAT) today. At the current pace, the Nasdaq Composite is looking at a 7% gain for the week, giving it a year-to-date advance of about 3%. Whipsaw Trading 12:18 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets are seeing green as of early afternoon trading in what has been a whipsaw trading session for investors. All three of the major stock market indices are now seeing green, but there is a lack of conviction in either direction today. The Nasdaq Composite is being lifted by stocks like Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Linde (Nasdaq: LIN), with gains of 3% and 2%, respectively. While the latest wholesale price data shows inflation is waning, policymakers aren&#8217;t convinced. NY Fed official John Williams predicts economic growth will slow to a mere 1% in 2025, blaming tariffs for what he expects could result in 4% inflation by year-end. Stocks Flip Green 10:00 am by Gerelyn Terzo As of mid-morning trading, the stock market has turned higher, with all three of the major stock market averages now seeing green. Most sectors of the economy are now trading higher, led by materials and technology, each of which are up about 1%. The economy is still uncertain, but inflation is headed in the right direction &#8211; lower. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warned on CNBC that a recession might have already reared its head in the U.S. economy. Here&#8217;s a look at where things stand at last check: Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 198.68 (+0.48%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 129.17 (+0.79%) S&amp;P 500: Up 24.31 (+0.40%) The markets remain fearful, falling modestly at the open across the board amid what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has called a turbulent economy. Dimon also warned that S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates are going to be revised downward as corporate American continues to cancel their current outlooks, some of which have already begun to do so. He expects that American banks will be in the crosshairs of the trade wars. Markets are also weighing some better than expected economic data on the inflationary front. Wholesale price declined by 0.4% last month, yet another indication of waning inflation as the Federal Reserve gears up for its May meeting on interest rates. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 305.83 (-0.77%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 78.09 (-0.44%) S&amp;P 500: Down 32.54 (-0.66%) Market Movers It&#8217;s a tale of two markets for the chip stocks today. Texas Instruments (Nasdaq: TXN) is falling a steep 8.9% to about its 52-week low level. The stock was trading in the $200 area last month to currently hover at $142 per share. On the flip side, Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is gaining 4.3% today to nearly $94 per share. The stock was well over $100 per share in recent weeks and has been volatile. Earnings season has begun. Financial stock Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) reported better-than-expected Q1 profit results, sending shares up about 1%. The company&#8217;s results were fueled by robust stock market trading, leading to a record performance in that business. Advertising technology company AppLovin (Nasdaq: APP) shares are under pressure today, falling 6% to below $250 per share as the tug-of-war in that stock continues to unfold. Bitcoin bull MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) is rising 5% on the day alongside a rising BTC price.

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Markets Go Their Own Way 1:20 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market indices are trading mixed, with the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 posting fractional gains while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is sharply lower, losing 300 points. UnitedHealth Group stock has been a weight on the Dow and S&amp;P 500 today after its worrying quarterly results and outlook. Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON), which is part of the Nasdaq Composite, is gaining over 2% on the day. The company reports its quarterly results on April 29. The company is in the midst of spinning off a couple of business divisions, and the stock is nearing the $200 per share level. Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) is down 1% after BMO Capital cut its price target on the stock to $200 per share, which still represents upside from current levels of $151 per share. Texas Instruments (Nasdaq: TXN) is gaining 1.5% on the day as the company expands its chip footprint in the auto sector. Market Gains Slip 8:17 am The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are struggling to keep their grip on gains after coming out of the gate higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains pressured with a 1.2% loss on the day. UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) stock is a major drag on the Dow, owing to disappointing quarterly results, while CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) remains a bright spot, rising 1.2% on the day. Chip stock Qualcomm (Nasdaq: QCOM) is up nearly 1% this morning on a bullish report out of Citi analysts. Sector performance is largely positive, led by a 2.4% gain in energy stocks but dampened by a tech sector that has just turned south. After yesterday&#8217;s massive technology sell-off, the markets are licking their wounds, with the three major stock market averages giving a mixed showing. Among the gainers is the Nasdaq Composite with a 0.63% advance and the S&amp;P 500 also fractionally higher while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently erasing over 400 points. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green today, a complete reversal from yesterday&#8217;s leader board. The markets are still processing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell&#8217;s comments from yesterday, which were on the hawkish side of monetary policy. Earnings are capturing some attention away from tariffs with railway CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) gaining 1% on the heels of its Q1 print. CSX faced challenges in the quarter, including a 7% year-over-year decline in revenue, but met consensus expectations amid a backdrop of weaker coal prices and dwindling fuel surcharges. Big Tech is mostly showing green this morning but remains mired in losses over the past five-day stretch, including a 2% drop in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), 14% decline in Meta (Nasdaq: META) and nearly 9% drop in Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) over the past week or so. UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) is a big drag on the Dow, shaving off 18% of its value today alone on disappointing earnings results. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 446 (-1.09%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 118.75 (+0.65%) S&amp;P 500: Up 22 (+0.41%) Market Movers Qualcomm (Nasdaq; QCOM) is rising today on the heels of a bullish report out of Citi analysts, who reportedly raised estimates on the company and added it to their positive catalyst watchlist thanks to robust demand for its chipsets out of China. QCOM stock has been volatile and is down 11% year-to-date. Citi also likes Generac Holdings (Nasdaq: GNRC), upgrading the stock to &#8220;buy&#8221; with a &#8220;high-risk&#8221; tone from &#8220;neutral.&#8221; BMO has upgraded shares of wood producer (NYSE: TREX) Trex to &#8220;outperform&#8221; from &#8220;market perform,&#8221; calling shares attractive. The stock is up 1.8% today. The post Live Nasdaq Composite: CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) Rises Amid Pivot to Earnings appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Nasdaq Composite Spirals 4% Lower 3:11 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets have widened their losses after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell addressed tariffs and their impact on the economy. Chairman Powell warned that tariffs could throw a wrench into the central bank&#8217;s efforts to tame inflation and spur economic growth. The Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach to monetary policy in the meantime. The Nasdaq Composite is spiraling 4% lower, weighed down by a 9% drop in Nvidia (Nasdaq; NVDA) and other Big Tech names on the tariff fallout. All sectors of the economy are lower with the exception of energy, which is up 1% as a group. Here&#8217;s a look at where things stand as of late afternoon trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 847.60 (-2.10%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 713.07 (-4.24%) S&amp;P 500: Down 161.77 (-3%) Gainers in a Sea of Red 12:32 pm by Gerelyn Terzo While the markets are a sea of red, including a 2.1% drop in the Nasdaq Composite, there are some gainers if you dig deep enough. We found a few, including: eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) is up 2.5% on the day and is inching closer to its 52-week high of approximately $71 per share. The online auction platform could be gaining from a newly announced partnership with Checkout.com for payments. Bitcoin stock MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) is tacking on 1.2% today while the bitcoin price continues to hover below the $85,000 level. On its best day, bitcoin serves as an inflationary hedge from the economy, which stands to benefit MSTR stock. Expand Energy (Nasdaq: EXE) is gaining 1.7% as a rising energy sector lifts those boats. Tariff Fallout 10:04 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure as of mid-morning trading, with the three major stock market averages stuck in a rut. While March retails sales rose a higher than expected 1.4%, the markets are obsessed with Nvidia (Nasdaq; NVDA), which warned that it will take a massive $5.5 billion charge for processor exports to China, giving the markets their &#8216;I told you so&#8217; moment. Magnificent Seven stocks are each down in the ballpark of 2% this morning, including Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), whose market cap has dipped below the $3 trillion threshold. The markets are under pressure out of the gate despite stronger than anticipated economic data. All three of the major stock market averages are trading in the red, including a 1.7% drop in the Nasdaq Composite, which is being weighed down by Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA). On the flip side, Applied Digital (Nasdaq: APLD) is gaining 5% today, bucking the otherwise downward trend, on the heels of its fiscal Q3 results. Despite missing Wall Street&#8217;s expectations, Applied Digital is benefiting from its roll in data center infrastructure for AI and high-performance computing, two white-hot tech trends. The gold price is rising 2.4% today to $3,319.30 per ounce as investors flock to the inflationary hedge during these times of heightened uncertainty. Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) is gaining 4% on the day as a beneficiary of the gold rush. The technology sector is being dragged lower by NVDA stock after the company revealed an upcoming $5.5 billion charge related to chip exports to China, igniting trade war selling once again. Nvidia shares are sinking 5.6% today. Most sectors of the economy are down, including a 2.4% decline for technology, while energy stocks are up by 1%. Each of the Magnificent 7 stocks is lower today. Retail sales grew by 1.4% in March, stronger than the expected 1.2% increase and providing yet another sign of a resilient U.S. consumer. Results excluding auto sales also beat economist projections, coming in at 0.5% vs. estimates of 0.3% even in the face of tariff uncertainty targeting the auto sector. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 165.73 (-0.41%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 292.95 (-1.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 47.89 (-0.90%) Market Movers BofA analysts have reiterated their &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Nvidia stock, but it&#8217;s doing little to lift sentiment in shares today. The Wall Street firm also lowered their price target on NVDA to $160 from $200 per share, blaming tariff uncertainty. Oppenheimer analysts have begun coverage on new stock Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) with an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating attached. Piper Sandler likes Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stock, reiterating its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on the EV maker while lowering the price target from $450 to $400 per share.

      "title": "Live: Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) Ignores Tariffs, Rises on Bank Earnings",
      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Another market reversal 1:03 pm by Joel South U.S. stock markets advanced, with the S&amp;P 500 increasing by 1.4%, the Dow rising 484 points (1.2%), and the Nasdaq gaining 1.7%, even as trade disputes and weak consumer confidence fueled earlier fluctuations. This rebound follows China&#8217;s imposition of 125% tariffs on U.S. products, contributing to persistent uncertainty after a turbulent week sparked by U.S. tariff announcements. The stock market is shrugging off the latest salvo between the U.S. and China over trade. All stock indices opened slightly higher at the morning bell, with the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) up 0.7%. China raised its tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%, matching the rate President Trump had imposed on Chinese imports. Beijing, though, said it no longer matters what further increases the U.S. hits it with as it will not respond because &#8220;Given that, at the current tariff level, U.S. exports to China are no longer commercially viable, China will not respond to any further tariff hikes by the U.S. on Chinese goods.&#8221; With Trump having essentially eliminated the de minimis rule that Chinese marketplaces like Temu and Schein used to ship cheap goods to the U.S. duty-free, it&#8217;s not unreasonable to say trade between the U.S. and China is dead. Big names bolster market Although most components of the Vanguard ETF are down, the biggest components of the index are moving higher. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), representing the second largest position in the exchange-traded fund at over 6%, is up more than 2%, helping to drive the ETF higher. Even though top dog Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in the red, it is almost at break-even so its impact is negligible. Yet some components are up strongly in morning trading. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which is the eighth largest position, is up 3.4%. The AI chipmaker&#8217;s stock has held up better than most over the tumultuous week with shares 22% higher. Banking on trading turmoil What is buoying stocks this morning are the results of bank stock earnings starting to come in with giants like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) reported record revenue on higher trading despite caution over economic headwinds. JPM stock represents 1.5% of VOO&#8217;s portfolio, just behind 10th place Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) at 1.6%. JPMorgan is up 2% in morning trading. Other financial stocks in the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF that reported earnings today include Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), both of which had better than expected results. Yet banks were also being very cautious and were setting aside larger amounts for credit losses. It suggests they foresee tougher times coming and are preparing for the worst. JPMorgan&#8217;s provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter rose to $3.3 billion from $2.6 billion. Wells Fargo&#8217;s provision, however, was lower than expected. It set aside $932 million, less than the $1.2 billion Wall Street wass anticipating. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s credit loss provision was just $135 million, but it is markedly higher than the $6 million et aside in its year-ago first quarter.

      "title": "Donald Trump Campaigned on Cutting Corporate Taxes – Where Does That Promise Stand Today?",
      "content": "President Donald J. Trump’s 2024 electoral campaign was buoyed by the hope that his leadership would return the economic prosperity of his previous term, which had been decimated by Bidenomics and rampant Congressional spending, fueling inflation to the worst levels in 40 years. Central to President Trump’s strong economic performance from 2016-2020 was the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. TCHA resulted in unprecedented business growth, new entrepreneurism, historically low unemployment among all ethnic groups, and consumer confidence soaring to an 18-year high. The 21% corporate rate is one of the few permanent aspects to TCJA not subject to expiration. President Trump has been adamant about the need to renew TCJA, as other key provisions expire in December, 2025. He is also proposing additional tax cuts, such as taxes on overtime, tips, Social Security payments, and has even proposed eliminating federal income tax altogether, to be replaced with revenues from a national consumption tax and tariffs. However, analysts have debated the merits of further tax cuts, the impact on the national debt, and whether or not Congress would ultimately be able to legislate these proposals into law. Key Points The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) delivered unprecedented business growth and entrepreneurism, in addition to additional retained money in the pockets of a majority of American citizens. President Trump campaigned on cutting taxes further on a number of fronts, including renewal of TCJA before its expiration in December, 2025. Many analysts who have debated over the effectiveness of further tax cuts fail to include the massive regulatory cuts, the large pending reductions in wasteful spending being identified by DOGE, and the resultant job creation, business growth, and fresh investment into US business as a result of the tariff policies.

Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Arguments Against Tax Cuts and The Truth Senator Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is one of the main opponents to tax cuts and reduced spending that take away power from Democrats&#8217; pet projects. Not surprisingly, the entirety of elected Democrats, as well as left-leaning Republicans, have been the loudest voices against cutting taxes. Democrat leaders like Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have been among the more articulate critics, although their mantras about “tax cuts would only be for the top 1%” and that “the rich don’t pay their fair share” have been thoroughly debunked by genuine statistics and even left leaning Factcheck.org. In actuality, TCJA benefited over 75% of all US taxpayers, and it has been verified that the top 1%, in fact, pay 40% of the entirety of federal income tax. The Congressional Budget Office’s analysis projects that a TCJA extension would create increased deficits based on reduced tax revenues from present levels. It forecasts a $4.6 trillion shortfall over 10 years, accounting for interest on outstanding federal debt. The Tax Policy Center projected that economic growth would offset only 6% of the shortfall. One crucial point is that neither the CBO or TPC prognostications take into account any significant spending cuts nor how tariffs will accelerate cutting deficits, as well as other key policy ramifications already in effect in the Trump Administration: How tariffs are creating fresh US investment, new businesses, and more crucial private sector jobs. The impact of lower tax rates and the elimination of onerous Biden-imposed regulatory burdens are jump-starting new manufacturing and other major business creation. How ending potential trillions in fraudulent, misappropriated, and likely criminal spending waste from USAID and numerous other federal agencies uncovered by DOGE will accelerate the goal towards eliminating the trillions in federal debt overhang via drastically reduced spending. Why a national consumption tax effectively rebuts Democrat opponents’ claims of “unfairness” and “only favoring the rich”. Trump Fiscal Policy Results In The First 60+ Days Cutting the trillions of wasteful and criminal spending of taxpayer dollars uncovered by Elon Musk and DOGE could accelerate President Trump&#8217;s plans to fix the US economy and restore manufacturing and other critical businesses. Since taking office in January, the threat of Trump&#8217;s tariffs has already created a seismic shift in the corporate business environment. For example: In response to prospective 25% tariffs on products made in Taiwan, Taiwan Semiconductor, the maker of all of the GPUs from Nvidia and AMD required to run Artificial Intelligence, announced a $100 billion investment into new factories to be located in AZ for making GPUs and other semiconductor products expressly for the US market. SoftBank Group Corp. from Japan pledged to invest $50 billion in the US to create 50,000 new jobs. Apple announced it invested $500 billion for AI servers to be built in Michigan and Texas, creating 20,000 new jobs. Oracle, ChatGPT, and OpenAI announced its Stargate JV would invest up to $500 billion for AI infrastructure construction, creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs in various states, commencing with Texas. The revival of US-manufactured steel and copper is already underway, thanks to US tariffs to prevent dumping from China and other nations into the US market. Additionally, Elon Musk’s DOGE has been uncovering misappropriated taxpayer funds, payments to nonexistent recipients, and useless pork projects ostensibly designed to serve as political kickbacks and bribes to overseas entities, all of which are in the process of being cut. The anticipated spending cuts, something not factored into the CBO calculations, could drastically accelerate the rate of reducing the federal debt. A recent CBS poll found that 77% of the American public supports the work of DOGE. Lastly, a consumption tax, proposed as a 14-17% tax on all new goods except for food and medicine, would be a tax that visibly and unequivocally hits the wealthiest the hardest, thus debunking any accusations about unfairness. With no loopholes, a flat consumption tax is based on the value of the purchased item. Since expensive goods that are only affordable for the wealthy have a higher price tag, the commensurate tax revenues from those items will generate more tax revenues. President Trump was given a mandate by the electorate. While he has already enacted some of his plans to good effect, his tax and regulatory cutting proposals will still require much combating with Democrats, the predominant recipients of high taxes and big government spending. Over the next 4 years, the results of these battles will determine the extent of the initiatives’ full financial benefits.

      "title": "I have $3,000 to invest: Should I go all in on SCHD or mix it with VOO?",
      "content": "The market climate at the time of this writing can be described in a number of ways, but “boring” is certainly not one of them. Ever since President Donald Trump announced his policy of reciprocal tariffs to level the international trade playing field, the stock and bond markets have both become cyclonic in their volatility. 2,000+ point intraday swings in either direction on the Dow Jones Average and a 50 basis point swing for the 10-year Treasury Bond yield in less than a month have given even veteran investors bouts of nausea. As a result, investors from all levels of experience are looking at their portfolios and considering reassessment of their holdings, at least to better handle the current volatility and to reduce the sleepless nights of worry. Key Points The current turbulence in the stock markets are giving both novice and seasoned investors some cause for reconsidering their portfolio compositions. ETFs like SCHD have aspects like dividend focus, which may make them less volatile than ones like VOO, which exclusively tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index. People who are new to investing can find the gigantic menu of choices overwhelming and intimidating, so knowing one’s own goals and risk tolerance before selecting an investment vehicle is a prudent rule of thumb to follow. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Navigating Through A Huge Menu Of Selections The huge array of available investment selections can be intimidating and overwhelming neophyte investors. A relatively new investor with $3,000 to invest was seeking vehicle suggestions, and posted a question on Reddit. He was considering the following, but was open to any other suggestions: He was considering investing in the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE: SCHD) based on what he’d read from other posts. The poster was looking to contribute $100 per week to take advantage of compounding and dollar cost averaging. Admittedly young and inexperienced, he did understand how investing for the long-term was to his advantage, so he was not seeking quick, short-term gains. He was concerned with putting all of his cookies in a single basket, so was inquiring about opinions on diversifying an allocation into the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO). To his credit, the poster realizes now that the Millennial FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) meme of “VOO and chill” might not be an appropriate direction to take in the current climate. Nevertheless, he acknowledges the long-term track record of the S&amp;P 500 and how it has benefited millions who have contributed to it regularly and let it compound to build wealth. As the poster has already established long term goals, assessing risk tolerance is probably the next factor to identify before finalizing his course of action. Taking a closer look at SCHD and VOO is probably a prudent step to accomplish this step. (All market quote details are as of the time of this writing.) Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF The Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF is an exchange traded fund that is designed to track The Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index.

As one might expect, a number of the respondents agreed that some diversification was a good idea, as was the plan to invest a new contribution every week. Some of the the specifics included: Due to his youth, some suggested that it would behoove the poster to focus more on growth, and suggested SCHG (Schwab Large Cap Growth ETF), which has a superior ROI history over SCHD. In either case, reinvesting dividends to leverage compounding over the long haul was advised. Some lauded the dividend consideration, since the extra income could serve as a safety net in the event that the poster’s job were to be in jeopardy in the future. Another respondent agreed with adding VOO, but also including an ETF for international exposure so that in the event of a US economic downturn, there would be non-US holdings that could potentially offset any bearishness from the other holdings.

      "title": "JPMorgan’s Mislav Matejka Suggests Caution Amid Elevated Risks",
      "content": "<p>Stocks may present <strong>buying opportunities in the second half (2H) of 2025</strong>, according to JPMorgan strategist <strong>Mislav Matejka</strong>, although he remains cautious for now due to ongoing macro risks, weak economic data, and uncertainty surrounding trade policy. In his latest strategy note, Matejka emphasized that a more bullish stance will only materialize once certain conditions are met.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\"We continue to think that we would be buyers of risk sometime in 2H,\" Matejka remarked, but warned that several key factors need to fall into place first.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Key Conditions for a Bullish Stance</h3>\r\n<p>For JPMorgan to become more constructive on the stock market, several things need to happen:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Hard data</strong> must improve to close the gap with <strong>soft data</strong>.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Earnings projections</strong> need to be reset, and weak guidance needs to be cleared out.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>The <strong>tariff situation</strong> needs to stabilize in the coming months.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Despite some positive data points, such as <strong>industrial production</strong> and <strong>job growth</strong>, economic indicators have softened, particularly in the areas of <strong>consumer sentiment</strong>, <strong>labor market perceptions</strong>, and <strong>future output expectations</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Weekly earnings revisions have dropped to their weakest levels in years, and the number of announced job cuts has reached recessionary levels. <strong>Challenger job cuts</strong>, often an indicator of economic slowdowns, are now reaching levels typically associated with recessions.</p>\r\n<h3>The Ongoing Trade Headwind</h3>\r\n<p>Trade remains a significant risk factor for global markets, particularly the U.S., where <strong>tariff proposals</strong> continue to hang over the market&rsquo;s outlook. While there has been some easing of extreme tariff proposals, <strong>Matejka</strong> warns that <strong>tariffs</strong> are likely to remain much higher than anticipated earlier in the year. JPMorgan economists estimate that current proposals could raise the effective U.S. tariff rate to 23%, which would amount to a $730 billion tax increase (roughly 2.4% of GDP). This would be the largest tariff increase since World War II.</p>\r\n<p>The looming uncertainty around trade tensions and their potential impact on global supply chains and economic growth is a critical consideration for investors. As trade negotiations continue to evolve, keeping an eye on <strong>economic data releases</strong>, such as those available through the <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#economics-calendar-economics-data\">Economic Calendar API</a>, will provide important context for market movements.</p>\r\n<h3>Monitoring Market Sentiment and Economic Data</h3>\r\n<p>For investors eyeing opportunities in the stock market, key indicators will remain critical in the months ahead. The impact of tariff adjustments, earnings resets, and broader economic shifts will be pivotal in shaping the outlook for 2H 2025. Understanding these factors and their potential effects on global markets is essential, especially as the <strong>trade situation</strong> continues to evolve.</p>\r\n<p>By staying up to date with relevant <strong>market overviews</strong> and <strong>economic events</strong>, investors can be better positioned to navigate the uncertainty and make informed decisions. For instance, tracking <strong>market overviews</strong> through sources like the <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#market-overview\">FMP Market Overview API</a> offers valuable insights into real-time market conditions and potential shifts.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
