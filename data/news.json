      "content": "<h2>Apple&rsquo;s AI Independence Under Review</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)</strong> is reportedly exploring a <strong>strategic shift in its AI roadmap</strong>, potentially outsourcing <strong>core capabilities of Siri</strong> to third-party large language models like <strong>Anthropic&rsquo;s Claude</strong> or <strong>OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT</strong>. According to a Bloomberg report, Apple is testing whether these external AI systems could be embedded within its own cloud infrastructure&mdash;a stark departure from its previously self-reliant approach to AI development.</p>\r\n<p>This move is <strong>not merely technical</strong>&mdash;it&rsquo;s strategic, reputational, and deeply financial. It could impact Apple&rsquo;s long-standing narrative of full-stack control, especially across privacy, optimization, and system integration.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Why This Matters: Siri Is Lagging in a Post-ChatGPT Era</h2>\r\n<p>Apple&rsquo;s in-house <strong>Apple Foundation Models</strong> were expected to power Siri&rsquo;s next major upgrade by 2026. But with the <strong>acceleration in generative AI innovation</strong>, that timeline may now look too slow and too risky.</p>\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s driving the potential pivot:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>ChatGPT and Claude have leapfrogged industry expectations</strong>, redefining consumer interaction standards</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Apple&rsquo;s Siri, in its current form, <strong>lags behind</strong> Google Assistant, Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa, and even the GPT-powered integrations in smartphones and productivity apps</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Licensing external LLMs could <strong>expedite time-to-market</strong> and help Apple stay competitive in voice and AI interfaces</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Still, <strong>embedding third-party AI introduces new tensions</strong>&mdash;from data privacy compliance to reliance on external talent and infrastructure.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Financial Implications: Is Apple Signaling a Slowdown in AI Capabilities?</h2>\r\n<p>Using the <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#full-financial-as-reported-financial-statements\"><strong>Full Financials as Reported API</strong></a>, we can see Apple&rsquo;s <strong>R&amp;D expenses rose to over $30 billion in FY 2023</strong>, with significant investment earmarked for on-device intelligence and foundational model research.</p>\r\n<p>The question is: <strong>why pivot now?</strong></p>\r\n<p>This may suggest that:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Apple&rsquo;s in-house models are not scaling as fast</strong> or as reliably as expected</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s <strong>a gap between technical ambition and market-ready output</strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>The company recognizes that <strong>consumer expectations in AI have outpaced internal delivery cycles</strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Apple&rsquo;s Market Stability Remains Strong&mdash;for Now</h2>\r\n<p>Despite the short-term volatility in AAPL shares, Apple&rsquo;s <strong>underlying risk profile remains stable</strong>. According to the <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#company-rating-company-information\"><strong>Company Rating API</strong></a>, the company still maintains high-grade investment ratings and consistent risk-adjusted returns across its business verticals.</p>\r\n<p>Apple&rsquo;s advantage lies in:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Its <strong>ecosystem control</strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>A <strong>loyal global user base</strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Enormous <strong>cash reserves</strong> to finance R&amp;D pivots without compromising short-term shareholder returns</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s why even if this AI course correction signals internal challenges, <strong>Wall Street isn&rsquo;t pricing it as a red flag&mdash;yet</strong>.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>What&rsquo;s Next: Siri 2.0 or a Trojan Horse?</h2>\r\n<p>If Apple does outsource core AI to OpenAI or Anthropic:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Expect a <strong>hybrid rollout</strong>, starting with opt-in beta testing for power users</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Apple could <strong>license custom-trained models</strong>, retaining privacy and system integrity</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Long term, this move may be a <strong>temporary detour</strong>, not a surrender&mdash;Apple may still aim to build proprietary LLMs at scale for future iOS releases</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>But the reputational risk remains: if Apple, the tech company known for tight vertical integration, now relies on rivals for core AI infrastructure, <strong>what does that signal about its innovation edge in the age of generative AI?</strong></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Final Take</h2>\r\n<p>Apple&rsquo;s reported talks with <strong>OpenAI and Anthropic</strong> mark a pivotal inflection point&mdash;not just for Siri, but for how Apple defines its place in the <strong>next wave of AI transformation</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>While investors shouldn&rsquo;t panic, they <strong>should pay attention</strong>. The AI race is a marathon, but <strong>Apple&rsquo;s next few steps could define whether it&rsquo;s still leading the pack or catching up.</strong></p>",

      "title": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Predicts AI’s ‘Make or Break’ Moment is Almost Here",
      "content": "Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) researchers recently released a paper named &#8216;Illusions of Thinking&#8216; that casts new doubts on the capabilities of &#8216;reasoning&#8217; models that are seeing tens of billions of dollars of research and development in the AI space. In the segment below, 24/7 Wall St. Analyst Eric Bleeker breaks down the implications of Apple&#8217;s newest paper. Bleeker says that investors will want to key in on whether AI can make &#8216;novel discoveries&#8217; in 2026. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has predicted that leading AI models will begin making these discoveries in 2026. If that happens, AI spending will continue to race full speed ahead. If 2026 passes without novel discoveries, then Apple&#8217;s criticisms of reasoning models will look more compelling. Key Points Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is taking a contrarian stance in the AI space, downplaying reasoning model capabilities in a recent research paper and showing reduced AI emphasis at WWDC, contrasting sharply with peers&#8217; aggressive AI investments. While OpenAI, backed by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), is pushing toward novel AI discoveries by 2026 with infrastructure like Stargate, Apple appears culturally and strategically hesitant to embrace foundational AI advancements. Despite skepticism from Apple’s research, usage data and capabilities like DeepMind&#8217;s AlphaFold show current AI can already dramatically accelerate scientific discovery, offering substantial near-term economic value.

Instead its relying on partnerships with companies like OpenAI. At 24/7 Wall St., we believe the release of reasoning models &#8211; roughly corresponding to the release of o3 in December last year … Is the next step-change in AI model capabilities. However, a recent paper from Apple researchers casts doubt on the overall capabilities of reasoning models. The paper &#8211; named &#8216;Illusions of Thinking&#8217; &#8211; detailed how reasoning models solve a series of puzzles. The paper&#8217;s findings were essentially that reasoning models capabilities are more limited than believed &#8211; they&#8217;re just advanced pattern matching. Our take: we don’t find the paper especially compelling. We won’t get into too many details, but AI researchers we follow have poked some pretty sizable holes into how the study was conducted and its overall conclusions. Here&#8217;s what we think is important to watch if you&#8217;re concerend about Apple&#8217;s recent paper. One of the biggest criticisms of AI has been: Where are the novel discoveries? That is to say, while AI has contributed to some major discoveries like protein-folding, there have been no major discoveries directly made by leading AI models. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, recently published a blog that’s worth reading. It&#8217;s named &#8216;The Gentle Singularity.&#8217; In it, he lays out a timeline we can come back to and hold him accountable to. 2025: Rise of Agents 2026: Novel insights from AI 2027: Robots that can do tasks in the real world So, essentially he’s dropping the gauntlet that GPT5 will be powerful enough for these novel discoveries… If that’s the case, the upside for AI essentially becomes infinite; it is the driver for economic progress for the remainder of our lives. If it’s wrong… Total spend on AI is likely too high at current rates. The AI Investor Podcast Is Your Source What Could Become Technology&#8217;s Biggest Trend Ever This discussion comes from 24/7 Wall St.&#8217;s AI Investor Podcast. The podcast covers the biggest developments in AI and how you can build a portfolio filled with the highest-upside stocks in the space. You can listen to our most recent episode on YouTube or leading podcast apps like Apple Podcasts or Spotify. Transcript: [00:00:05] Austin Smith: And now, you know, a, a counterpoint to that is I wanna talk about this Apple Illusions of thinking paper, because Apple is one of the largest tech companies that, you know what I mean? Like, like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Microsoft was really hot on AI. But in their most recent, uh, worldwide developer conference, there was way less AI, way less Apple intelligence than in the prior release. [00:00:24] Austin Smith: So on one hand, we&#8217;re seeing Apple sort of standalone here, and some of the, the steam is coming out of their own AI enthusiasm and they&#8217;re releasing this illusions of thinking paper that sort of puts a little bit of cold water on the AI narrative. So, but, but everything else we&#8217;re seeing is an increase in demand and compute and inference from everybody else in Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and Microsoft and Google. [00:00:45] Austin Smith: So. What is going on with Apple? Are they, you know, is this a cultural change? Is this, is this something? Are they seeing something other people don&#8217;t? Why does Apple sort of stand alone here in this super major AI space? [00:00:58] Eric Bleeker: Yeah. Apple&#8217;s such an interesting company, right? Because everyone else is spending tens of billions of dollars on CapEx and they&#8217;ve kind of not played that game. [00:01:07] Eric Bleeker: They can do that in part because they have unique distribution right at the start of smartphones. You have said their greatest weakness is. Something like search all these Google services, they, they don&#8217;t control that and they&#8217;re beholding, but the end outcome was they end up charging Google 20 or $30 billion per year in pure profits to become the default search engine. [00:01:29] Eric Bleeker: So them being that initial point of distribution as the operating system for all consumer devices allows them to play a little bit of a different game. But it&#8217;s also kind of in their best interests. To kind of talk down some of the areas that they&#8217;re not competing in, which is a bit what this paper did. [00:01:50] Eric Bleeker: It comes from, um, apple researchers and basically we&#8217;ve talked about along this show, our belief is that in December of last year, the birth of new powerful reasoning models, which really began when oh three was released on December 20th, was the next step change in AI demand. And what Apple&#8217;s researchers came out and said is that they believe that these reasoning models that are coming out through a series of puzzles that they tried having them solve, that they put in the paper, basically had just a lot less capability than people believed. [00:02:28] Eric Bleeker: Essentially. They&#8217;re just much better at pattern matching, uh, than people give them credit for. So this Austin, this got a lot of attention, right? Because it&#8217;s potentially saying it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s another. A potential piece of evidence that we&#8217;re in a bubble, that AI is just going to hit a wall, where when you ask it to take that next step, the next step being discovering novel discoveries. [00:02:55] Eric Bleeker: Mm-hmm. You know, asking AI to start doing things like finding cures for diseases. It&#8217;s not going to be able to make that jump. And if that is the case, that would be tremendously bad for that future of outlook and all the spending that&#8217;s happening right now. Right. So my take on this, and again, I am not an AI researcher. [00:03:16] Eric Bleeker: My main job is to basically find who I believe are the smartest minds and, and people that have great track records on this. I. And evaluate who I think is the most accurate. And, and I don&#8217;t find the paper especially compelling. I, I won&#8217;t get into too many details, but a lot of people have poked some pretty sizable holes into how this study was conducted. [00:03:39] Eric Bleeker: But I, I do wanna point out Austin, you know, of the other big storylines that&#8217;s, you know, maybe on the fringes that if, if you&#8217;re investing in ai you don&#8217;t see, was Sam Altman, who&#8217;s the CEO of Open AI. He released a blog this year, uh, or. This week, I should say, um, just about his thoughts on AI. It, it&#8217;s named the gentle Singularity. [00:04:01] Eric Bleeker: You could search that, you could search his blog and you could find it, but in layman&#8217;s terms, he&#8217;s, he&#8217;s making a lot of predictions you can hold him accountable to and in his belief. 2025. The story is the rise of agents. That&#8217;s something we agree with. We&#8217;ve been saying since last year, you know, mid last year, we&#8217;ve always said we believe the narrative this year, especially in the back half, would be the rise of agents. [00:04:27] Eric Bleeker: He believes 2026 is going to be the birth of novel insights from AI, and 2027 is robotics that can change the real world. So you know this, this lines up Austin, right? With a lot of storylines we&#8217;re talking about. But he is essentially dropping the gauntlet that, as I mentioned earlier, OpenAI is waiting for Stargate to become operational, uh, to basically train their next version, uh, GPT five, to have the capability to do that. [00:04:59] Eric Bleeker: And once that&#8217;s happened, he believes those novel discoveries will start becoming a storyline next year. So that becomes one of the things that we will be actively tracking on this podcast that. If you start seeing novel discoveries from AI, we are on pace. And frankly, if AI starts making meaningful novel discoveries, that is the strongest validation yet that it becomes the main economic driver for the rest of our lives. [00:05:30] Eric Bleeker: Mm-hmm. And if that is the case and, and you&#8217;re not actively investing in this, good luck to you because that, that will be a little bit of a rubber meets the road moment. We&#8217;re gonna be watching out for. [00:05:42] Austin Smith: Right. And you know, to, to anybody who&#8217;s listening to that and saying, oh, well maybe I&#8217;ll wait until AI has proven in the, the novel discovery framework before I become an investor. [00:05:51] Austin Smith: I think that would be a mistake as well, because that&#8217;s not to say that the current versions of AI and LLMs don&#8217;t have incredible economic forces and tailwinds behind them. You talked about medicine discovery, uh, famously alpha fold, you know, detected protein foldings and predicted 3D structures of proteins, which is a very complicated, uh, thing to do. [00:06:10] Austin Smith: And it didn&#8217;t necessarily uncover new breakthroughs per se, but it completely supercharged the discovery of these, uh, folding structures that would&#8217;ve been discovered just over a much longer timeframe. So it pulled forward all of those discoveries faster. Now, that might not necessarily have been novel. [00:06:26] Austin Smith: It was applying techniques that, as I understand it, certainly not an AI researcher, but was applying techniques that. We already had and knew, but just completely supercharged them and allowed us to make discoveries earlier. You know, when I read the, the, or tried to read, I should say, the illusions of Thinking paper by Apple, it, it sounded a little bit to me like a case. [00:06:45] Austin Smith: Maybe it&#8217;s just a case of someone coming from sour grapes a little bit like I. You know, Apple&#8217;s always been a bit of a taste maker company and designing the thing you, you didn&#8217;t know you needed and then you can&#8217;t live without. And they&#8217;ve been uniquely good at that, perhaps the best of all time. Um, but technologically speaking, a reasoning model just gives up a lot of that to, to the model. [00:07:02] Austin Smith: And it might be just culturally antithetical to, to what Apple is built on as a company. So, you know, I&#8217;m, I you gotta pay attention to everything that happens in this space. Apple&#8217;s incredibly gifted at what they do. Um, but this, this didn&#8217;t change my thinking about the potential of, of what we&#8217;re seeing. [00:07:17] Eric Bleeker: And I do wanna double click on one point you made there that you know, you can always say, I will just wait for this. Next, threat or overhang to resolve before I invest. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to go through the cycles that as new trends happen that you&#8217;re able to see in real time. [00:07:35] Eric Bleeker: There is always something new that says, there&#8217;s a reason I shouldn&#8217;t invest in this today. So if you&#8217;re waiting for one threat to go. There will be another. Nothing is an absolute slam dunk. Last week, Austin, we talked about the best time on a risk adjusted basis to buy Apple was six years after mobile started. [00:07:52] Eric Bleeker: Mm-hmm. Um, the trough of disillusionment for the internet itself came eight years after it started. There&#8217;s always going to be some new threat that, you know, unless you followed one of these cycles, to truly appreciate that you&#8217;re never going to make money investing in a perfectly rosy picture. It&#8217;s just really hard to understand that that&#8217;s part of why we wanted to start this podcast was to give that record of investing throughout the a i Age. [00:08:22] Eric Bleeker: &#8217;cause at some point in retrospect, it&#8217;ll be, I believe it&#8217;ll be of course. Why didn&#8217;t you invest in that AI was obvious, right? And it&#8217;s not obvious. And we&#8217;ve broken down all the areas where we had to be incredibly. Counter to the dominant narratives, you know, you&#8217;ll be able to go back around When we did our deep seek episodes, where we called it before it happened, where we broke it down after, and we have been knocking down a lot of these, you know, bear cases. [00:08:53] Eric Bleeker: It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not because we are blind cheerleaders for AI. Far from it, you know, we are people who want to make money and the only thing that makes you money in the long run is what happens in reality. But you know, again, we, we have believed that this story&#8217;s happening and, and we have gone through many of these threats in the front half of the year to have a show today that is. [00:09:19] Eric Bleeker: Largely just focused on acceleration and bullishness, which couldn&#8217;t be any different from what we were seeing five, six months ago.​ The post OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Predicts AI&#8217;s &#8216;Make or Break&#8217; Moment is Almost Here appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

      "title": "Tesla Q2 Delivery Preview: Can Autonomous Hype Offset Sliding Sales?",
      "content": "<h2>Wall Street Watches as Tesla Delivery Numbers Loom</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)</strong> is set to release its <strong>second-quarter vehicle delivery data on Wednesday</strong>, a crucial litmus test for the electric vehicle (EV) giant as it battles demand uncertainty, regulatory scrutiny, and the high-stakes personal brand of its CEO, <strong>Elon Musk</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Markets are anticipating <strong>deliveries of around 390,000 units</strong>, down sharply from <strong>443,956</strong> in the same quarter last year. The projected decline underscores the company&rsquo;s <strong>increasingly strained competitive position</strong>, especially in the U.S. and European markets where pricing power has eroded.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Sluggish Demand Meets Political Controversy</h2>\r\n<p>Tesla&rsquo;s <strong>first-quarter deliveries of 336,691 vehicles</strong> fell below analyst expectations, triggering renewed concerns about sustained demand&mdash;especially as the firm&rsquo;s revenue in Q1 missed forecasts. While Tesla has attempted to buffer the softness through:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Price cuts across key models</strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>A <strong>revamped Model Y SUV</strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Emphasis on <strong>autonomous vehicle capabilities</strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&hellip;the delivery print will likely determine how credible those efforts are in stabilizing near-term performance.</p>\r\n<p>Notably, public discomfort with Musk&rsquo;s <strong>perceived political alignment with Donald Trump</strong> may have weighed on brand sentiment in liberal-leaning markets&mdash;a risk that's difficult to quantify but potentially significant in Tesla&rsquo;s core customer base.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Historical Context: A Clear Downshift in Momentum</h2>\r\n<p>Using the <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#earnings-historical-earnings\"><strong>Earnings Historical API</strong></a>, analysts can track a progressive slowdown:</p>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Quarter</th>\r\n<th>Deliveries</th>\r\n<th>YoY Change</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Q2 2023</td>\r\n<td>443,956</td>\r\n<td>+83%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Q1 2024</td>\r\n<td>336,691</td>\r\n<td>-8%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Q2 2024 (Est)</td>\r\n<td>~390,000</td>\r\n<td>-12%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>The data highlights a turning point in Tesla&rsquo;s delivery arc&mdash;where <strong>volume deceleration aligns with weakening fundamentals</strong>.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Financial Stress Building Beneath the Surface</h2>\r\n<p>Tesla&rsquo;s top-line strain is now clearly reflected in its <strong>key financial metrics</strong>. Real-time insights from the <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#key-metrics-ttm-statement-analysis\"><strong>Key Metrics TTM API</strong></a> show:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>TTM Revenue</strong>: Down ~5% sequentially</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Gross Margin</strong>: Contracting due to aggressive discounting</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Return on Equity (ROE)</strong>: Falling from ~27% to under 20%</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Tesla&rsquo;s historic premium valuation was underpinned by <strong>growth, profitability, and technological leadership</strong>. But current trends suggest:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Growth is slowing</strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Margins are under pressure</strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Narrative strength is increasingly tied to autonomy hype</strong>, not EV dominance</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Autonomy: The New Tesla Bull Thesis?</h2>\r\n<p>In a bid to reignite enthusiasm, Musk has <strong>pivoted sharply toward autonomy</strong>, claiming Tesla has already completed its <strong>first driverless car delivery</strong> near its Austin Gigafactory. The footage, released via his platform X, showed a car navigating local streets with <strong>no human onboard</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>While promising, analysts remain cautious:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>No regulatory pathway</strong> exists for fully autonomous mass deployment</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Competitive platforms (e.g., Waymo, Cruise) have logged more miles in real-world testing</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Autonomy revenue projections remain <strong>highly speculative</strong> through 2025</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Still, if Musk can turn these demonstrations into commercial capability, Tesla could unlock a <strong>multi-billion-dollar mobility-as-a-service revenue stream</strong>.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Q2 Delivery = Q3 Sentiment Reset?</h2>\r\n<p>Investors are looking at <strong>Wednesday&rsquo;s delivery print</strong> as more than just a number. It&rsquo;s a proxy for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Demand durability</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Pricing power</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Market confidence in Tesla&rsquo;s next growth chapter</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Should deliveries fall short again, expect further downward pressure on the stock, already <strong>off ~14% YTD</strong>. But a surprise beat, especially if tied to a <strong>breakout in China or early fleet autonomy pilots</strong>, could <strong>reignite Tesla&rsquo;s growth multiple</strong>.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Final Word</h2>\r\n<p>As Tesla prepares to disclose its Q2 results, the focus is squarely on more than just delivery volume. Investors want proof that:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>The EV slowdown is temporary</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Musk&rsquo;s autonomy bets are credible</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Margin and growth headwinds are being addressed decisively</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Stay tuned for the numbers&mdash;and the next act in Tesla&rsquo;s high-voltage drama.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The U.S. dollar fell to its weakest versus the euro since September 2021, weighed down by fiscal concerns over the new spending bill, trade‑deal uncertainty and growing bets on Fed rate cuts. Here&rsquo;s a deeper look at the forces at work, the currency‑market implications and how to automate your monitoring.</p>\r\n<h2>Fiscal Risks and Trade Uncertainty</h2>\r\n<p>President Trump&rsquo;s proposed $3.3 trillion spending and tax‑cut bill has reignited worries about the U.S. deficit. When investors fear higher future debt issuance, they often sell dollars&mdash;especially against economies with stronger fiscal positions.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, stalled trade talks with key partners and tariff back‑and‑forth have dented confidence in the dollar as a safe haven.</p>\r\n<h2>Fed Easing Expectations</h2>\r\n<p>Market‑implied odds of Fed rate cuts have surged ahead of this week&rsquo;s data heavy agenda, notably Thursday&rsquo;s nonfarm payrolls. A more dovish Fed erodes the interest‑rate premium behind dollar‑bull trades, prompting further selling pressure.</p>\r\n<h2>Currency Performance Snapshot</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Euro:</strong> Near $1.1808, up 13.8% YTD&mdash;the strongest first‑half gain on record.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Sterling:</strong> Around $1.3739, close to a 3&frac12;‑year peak.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Yen:</strong> Firmed to &yen;143.77 per dollar, a 9% rally&mdash;the best start since 2016.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Dollar Index:</strong> Slipped to 96.612, the weakest since February 2022.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Implications for Investors</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Diversification Appeal:</strong> With fiscal and monetary risks rising, non‑ dollar assets and carry‑trade plays may outperform.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Import Costs:</strong> A weaker dollar makes imports more expensive, potentially stoking U.S. inflation.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Emerging Markets:</strong> Many EM currencies rallied; monitor for take‑profit signals as central banks respond.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Automate Your Currency Insights</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Pull daily FX rates for USD/EUR, USD/JPY and more via the <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#forex-daily-forex\">Forex Daily API</a>.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Schedule alerts for nonfarm payrolls, CPI and Fed announcements with the <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#economics-calendar-economics-data\">Economics Calendar API</a>.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />A mix of fiscal concerns, trade doubts and Fed‑cut bets has driven the dollar to multi‑year lows&mdash;trends you can track and act on in real time.

      "title": "July Rate Cut in Focus as Fed Signals Shift Amid Trump Pressure",
      "content": "<p>Investor bets on a Federal Reserve interest rate cut have started shifting from September to as early as July, following dovish signals from key Fed officials. Vice Chair Michelle Bowman, speaking in Prague on Monday, said she would support a rate cut &ldquo;as soon as our next meeting&rdquo; if inflation continues to trend lower.</p>\r\n<p>This sentiment echoes similar remarks by Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who emphasized that temporary price increases tied to trade tariffs shouldn't delay monetary easing. Their comments have added fuel to growing market speculation that the July 30 FOMC meeting could mark the start of rate cuts.</p>\r\n<h3>Fed Signals and Market Reaction</h3>\r\n<p>The probability of a 25 basis point cut in July has climbed to 23.5%, up from 15% last week, according to CME Fed Fund futures data. This shift aligns with cooling inflation trends observed in recent months.</p>\r\n<p>To track these evolving macroeconomic indicators, including inflation and unemployment data, investors can rely on the <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#economics-calendar-economics-data\">Economics Calendar API</a>, which consolidates key upcoming releases such as CPI, Core PCE, and Fed meeting dates.</p>\r\n<h3>Political Pressure and Powell's Position</h3>\r\n<p>President Donald Trump has been openly critical of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, accusing him of acting too slowly. Over the weekend, Trump reignited his public pressure campaign, stating Powell could &ldquo;save up to $1 trillion per year on interest payments&rdquo; with timely rate cuts.</p>\r\n<p>Although Powell has remained cautious, his leadership is increasingly under scrutiny. With the Fed&rsquo;s neutral rate policy now a major political and market talking point, July&rsquo;s meeting could become a pivotal moment in this cycle.</p>\r\n<h3>What to Watch</h3>\r\n<p>Market sentiment is being driven not just by Fed commentary, but also by actual data. Investors should monitor the coming weeks closely:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Inflation and wage prints</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Employment data</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Updated economic forecasts</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Central bank speeches</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For a real-time look at changing inflation metrics and Fed-related signals, the <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#economics-calendar-economics-data\">Interest Rate Indicators via Economics Calendar API</a> remains an essential resource for institutional and retail traders alike.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:<br />With political heat rising and inflation softening, the July FOMC meeting has become a key event for global markets. Whether the Fed acts or waits could determine the trajectory for equities, bonds, and currency markets heading into the second half of 2025.</p>",

The Nasdaq Composite is holding onto gains, up 0.46%. Bearish on Banks 10:07 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street firm Baird is bearish on a couple of banks. The analyst firm warned that recent gains in financial stocks JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) might soon be erased, owing to a questionable risk-reward future for both stocks. Baird handed both stocks downgrades, including JPM to an &#8220;underperform&#8221; and BAC to &#8220;neutral&#8221; with price targets of $235 and $52, respectively, attached.

(NASDAQ:HAS) Stock Analysis: A Look at Its Recent Performance and Future Prospects</title>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/financial-summary/HAS\">Hasbro Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS)</a> is a leading name in the <strong>toy and entertainment industry</strong>, known for iconic brands such as Monopoly, Nerf, and Transformers. The company's global operations span toys, games, and entertainment content creation, placing it in direct competition with giants like Mattel and LEGO. Michael Ng from Goldman Sachs recently set a price target of $85 for Hasbro, indicating a potential <strong>15.14% increase</strong> from its current price of $73.82.</p>\n\n<p>Hasbro's stock performance has been commendable, closing the latest trading session at $73.13, marking a <strong>1.13% increase</strong> from the previous day. This rise outperformed the S&P 500's 0.52% gain and the Dow's 1% uptick. Over the past month, Hasbro's stock has seen an <strong>8.25% increase</strong>, surpassing the Consumer Discretionary sector's 6.1% gain and the S&P 500's 5.95% rise. This positive trend supports the optimistic price target set by Goldman Sachs.</p>\n\n<p>The anticipation is high for Hasbro's upcoming earnings report, with an expected EPS of $0.77, which would be a <strong>36.89% decline</strong> from the same quarter last year. Revenue is projected at $872.3 million, marking a <strong>12.36% decrease</strong> from the previous year. Despite these anticipated declines, Hasbro is still considered a top momentum stock for the long term, according to Zacks Investment Research.</p>\n\n<p>With a market capitalization of approximately <strong>$10.34 billion</strong> and a trading volume of 1,980,306 shares on the NASDAQ exchange, Hasbro's stock has shown significant volatility. Today, the stock fluctuated between a low of $72.23 and a high of $73.97, with $73.97 being its highest price over the past year. The lowest price for the stock in the past year was $49, suggesting considerable growth potential.</p>",

      "content": "Key Points in This Article: CNBC’s Mad Money host Jim Cramer is often criticized for inaccurate stock picks that inspire routine bets against his calls as a better way to beat the market. Due to his unreliable predictions and over-the-top policy complaints, investors would be better served by focusing on company fundamentals. Nvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of &#8216;Next Nvidia Stocks&#8217; that could be even better. Click here to learn more. A Controversial Track Record Jim Cramer is a polarizing figure in financial media, known for hosting CNBC’s Mad Money and co-anchoring Squawk on the Street. A Harvard-educated former hedge fund manager, Cramer’s high-energy stock picks and market commentary have made him a household name among retail investors. However, his predictions are frequently criticized for their inconsistency, with many noting he’s often wrong about his stock calls. This reputation led to the creation of the Inverse Cramer ETF, which aimed to profit by betting against his recommendations. Although the ETF shut down due to lack of interest, an X account named “Inverse Cramer” continues to mock his calls, highlighting his spotty track record. Cramer’s bold, sometimes erratic takes &#8212; such a a recent essay he wrote on a so-called “Trump discount” &#8212; often spark debate, with critics pointing to his tendency to overemphasize short-term noise over long-term fundamentals, making his advice a risky bet for investors. Cramer’s “Trump Discount” Thesis In his June 1 article, Jim Cramer argues that a “Trump discount” is suppressing U.S. stock market performance due to the unpredictability of President Trump’s policies. He contrasts Europe’s “consistency of mediocrity” with U.S. volatility, claiming the White House’s immense power creates instability. Cramer cites examples across sectors: Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) gains were short-lived due to policy uncertainty; retail stocks like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) face tariff-related confusion; drug companies suffer from shifting Medicare pricing policies and vaccine skepticism; food companies like Campbell’s (NYSE:CPB) face regulatory pressure from RFK Jr.; Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) struggles with Trump’s push for U.S.-only manufacturing; software and internet giants like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) face unexpected scrutiny; banks see no regulatory relief; mergers and acquisitions are stalled by unpredictable cash flows; and energy stocks, despite Trump’s pro-drilling stance, lack momentum due to high costs and regulatory hurdles. Cramer predicts continued market declines, noting a recent 1% S&amp;P 500 drop, exacerbated by mixed signals about U.S.-China trade talks. Flaws in Cramer’s Argument Cramer’s thesis appears flawed for several reasons. First, his “Trump discount” overstates the impact of presidential policies on broad market performance. The S&amp;P 500, far from being discounted, has gained since he wrote his article, and is near record highs, contradicting his bearish outlook. Second, his sector-specific arguments lack depth. Nvidia’s volatility is more tied to market cycles and competition than Trump’s policies. Retailers like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and TJX (NYSE:TJX) have thrived despite tariff fears, with Costco’s stock rising due to strong fundamentals, not a “Trump premium.” Third, Cramer’s focus on short-term policy noise ignores long-term drivers like corporate earnings and consumer demand. His concerns about drug stocks, which he ties to RFK Jr.’s influence, overstate the impact of unconfirmed regulatory changes, since Medicare negotiation frameworks remain complex and slow-moving. Similarly, his critique of Apple misinterprets global supply chain dynamics; India’s manufacturing shift is a strategic diversification, not a policy misstep. Cramer’s Track Record and Market Misreads Cramer’s historical inaccuracy fuels skepticism. The Inverse Cramer ETF, though defunct, capitalized on his poor track record, and the ongoing X account highlights his frequent misses. His alarmist tone, comparing Trump’s influence to Andrew Jackson’s era, exaggerates political impact while downplaying market resilience. For instance, energy stocks’ stagnation is less about Trump’s policies and more about global oil prices and ESG pressures, which Cramer barely addresses. His claim that Europe’s markets outperform due to “consistency” ignores their own challenges, like Germany’s 2025 economic slowdown. By fixating on sensationalized policy risks, Cramer overlooks broader market trends, such as technology-driven gains and robust consumer spending, which have propelled the S&amp;P 500 upward. Key Takeaways As always, focus on fundamentals, not noise. Investors should tune out sky-is-falling narratives like Cramer’s, which amplify short-term concerns over fundamentals. However, blind optimism about endless market gains is equally misguided. Markets naturally rise and fall, influenced by policies but driven by earnings, innovation, and economic cycles. While presidential actions, like tariffs or deregulation, can create volatility, they don’t dictate long-term outcomes. Investors would do well to focus on business fundamentals &#8212; revenue growth, profit margins, and competitive advantages &#8212; rather than reacting to pundits like Cramer. Consistent, long-term investing, diversified across sectors, remains the most reliable path to wealth creation, regardless of political headlines.

As a leading energy company, it competes with other giants like ExxonMobil and Chevron. On June 26, 2025, Wells Fargo set a price target of <strong>$117</strong> for <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/financial-summary/COP\">COP</a>, suggesting a potential <strong>31.46%</strong> increase from its then-current price of <strong>$89</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, COP's stock closed at <strong>$91.71</strong>, marking a <strong>3.15%</strong> decline from its previous close. This drop contrasts with the broader market, where the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all saw gains. Despite this, COP has shown resilience, with an <strong>11.15%</strong> increase over the past month, outperforming the Oils-Energy sector's <strong>6.67%</strong> gain and the S&P 500's <strong>0.5%</strong> rise.</p>\n\n<p>Investors are closely watching ConocoPhillips' upcoming earnings report. The company is expected to announce earnings of <strong>$1.41</strong> per share, a <strong>28.79%</strong> year-over-year decline. However, quarterly revenue is anticipated to rise by <strong>5.52%</strong> to <strong>$14.92 billion</strong>, indicating strong sales performance despite the earnings drop.</p>\n\n<p>For the full fiscal year, Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of <strong>$6.21</strong> per share and total revenue of <strong>$62.36 billion</strong>. This outlook reflects the company's ability to maintain robust revenue streams, even as earnings face pressure.

Over the past year, the stock has reached a high of <strong>$118.40</strong> and a low of <strong>$79.88</strong>, showcasing its volatility. As investors consider Wells Fargo's price target, they weigh these fluctuations and the company's financial performance.</p>",

      "title": "West Wits secures ZAR 875M facility to launch Qala Shallows development",
      "content": "West Wits Mining Ltd (ASX:WWI, OTCQB:WMWWF) will bank ZAR 875 million (approximately US$50M, AU$76.5M) after signing definitive agreements for a senior syndicated loan facility to fund the Qala Shallows Gold Project in South Africa. This is a significant step in the development of the first phase of the Witwatersrand Basin Project and coincides with the delivery of a 7.5-tonne underground Load-Haul-Dump (LHD) unit to the Qala Shallows site, marking the start of on-the-ground mine development works. The development is expected to generate over 1,000 direct jobs and serve as a catalyst for regional development over the mine’s 18-year life. “The signing of the legal agreements marks a transformative moment for West Wits. Securing this facility is the result of years of focused effort and a strong endorsement of the Qala Shallows Project by top tier South African financial institutions,” West Wits CEO Rudi Deysel said. “Seeing our first LHD unit arrive on site is incredibly exciting. It is a tangible symbol of progress and the beginning of a new chapter as we bring the project to life.” West Wits has executed agreements for a senior syndicated loan facility with the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa and Absa Bank Ltd, through its Corporate and Investment Banking Division. The facility, which will fund approximately 55% of the Qala Shallows development costs, has a 24-month drawdown period and a 36-month repayment term. Interest is linked to the Johannesburg Interbank Average Rate (JIBAR), and 100% of mandatory hedging will be covered by put options, allowing upside exposure to gold prices. The loan will fund development, construction, commissioning and initial operations at Qala Shallows. The remaining 45% of funding will be sourced from equity and early operational revenue. Zwano Nxumalo, project financier at Absa Corporate and Investment Banking, said: “We’re proud to support West Wits on the Qala Shallows Gold Project — a development that will drive local job creation, economic growth, and sustainable mining in the Witwatersrand Basin. This facility reflects our continued commitment to enabling impactful, long-term investments in South Africa’s resources sector.” Following an A$14 million equity raise, West Wits is pressing ahead with mine development activities at Qala, after an increase in ownership of the broader Witwatersrand Basin Project (WBP) to 74%. LHD Unit loaded for delivery to Qala Shallows marking the start of mobilisation as West Wits moves into active development. Key work streams include the buy-back of minority interests in its South African subsidiary, an optimised Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) reflecting stronger gold prices and improved economics, mobilisation for ore extraction at Qala Shallows, and progress on its long-term Project 200 expansion strategy. “It is with great excitement that we kick-off the Qala Shallows Project. The West Wits team undertook extensive preparatory work to ensure that the project will be delivered as a safe, productive and within-budget operation. Service supplier agreements have now been executed with initial orders placed and the first piece of equipment to be delivered this week,” Deysel said. “As West Wits Mining advances to becoming a gold producer, we will continue to focus on ways to realise the potential of the stunning Witwatersrand Basin Project to further grow the business we are starting.” Facility proceeds are strictly applied to Qala Shallows project development. US President Donald Trump has announced the immediate termination of all trade talks with Canada, ending months-long negotiations between the two countries following Canada’s announcement of a new digital services tax (DST). The DST targets large foreign and domestic digital companies, including major US tech firms such as Meta, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. Set to take effect retroactively from 2022, starting on Monday, the DST imposes a 3% tax on large digital companies' revenues from online advertising, social media, online marketplaces, and user data licensing in Canada. Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social that due to this digital services tax, the US will end all trade discussions with Canada effective immediately and plans to inform Canada within the next week about the tariff rates Canada will be required to pay for conducting business with the US. He accused Canada of copying the European Union, which has implemented a similar tax, and described it as “a direct and blatant attack on our country.” “Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven day period.” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s office did not immediately comment on Trump’s remarks.",

The <strong>Dow Jones Industrial Average</strong> gained 375 points, or 0.89%, following a day of volatile trading.</p>\r\n<h3>Iran&rsquo;s Retaliation Falls Flat</h3>\r\n<p>Geopolitical jitters eased after Iran responded to the U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities with what President Trump called a &ldquo;very weak&rdquo; missile attack targeting a U.S. airbase in Qatar. According to media reports, Iran coordinated the strike with Qatari officials in advance, allowing U.S. forces to prepare and resulting in zero casualties.</p>\r\n<p>\"There have been 14 missiles fired &mdash; 13 were knocked down, and 1 was 'set free'... NO Americans were harmed,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. He praised Iran&rsquo;s pre-warning and called for a renewed path toward &ldquo;Peace and Harmony&rdquo; in the region.</p>\r\n<h3>Risk Appetite Returns as Fed Turns Dovish</h3>\r\n<p>Investor sentiment was further supported by <strong>dovish commentary from Fed Governor Michelle Bowman</strong>, who said she would support a <strong>rate cut as early as the July FOMC meeting</strong>, provided inflation remains subdued. Her remarks followed similar comments by Fed Governor Christopher Waller last week, shifting market expectations meaningfully.</p>\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#economics-calendar-economics-data\">Economics Calendar API</a>, upcoming inflation and jobs data will be key to determining whether a rate cut materializes at the July 30 meeting. Traders have already priced in a higher probability of policy easing, with CME FedWatch data showing the odds of a 25-bps cut rising to 23.5%.</p>\r\n<h3>Market Snapshot and Forward Look</h3>\r\n<p>Investors also rotated into tech and industrials, anticipating that lower borrowing costs and a reduced geopolitical risk premium could provide tailwinds for earnings in Q3. To track earnings dates and real-time results, analysts can rely on the <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#earnings-calendar-earnings\">Earnings Calendar API</a>, which helps gauge sentiment drivers across sectors.</p>\r\n<p>Despite the relief rally, markets remain sensitive to any unexpected escalation in the Middle East. U.S. military bases across the region remain on high alert, and Iran&rsquo;s political establishment has made it clear that future responses remain on the table.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:<br />With geopolitical fears easing and the Federal Reserve signaling a softer stance, risk assets found solid footing. But as always, markets will remain data-dependent&mdash;and any sign of renewed conflict or hot inflation could quickly reverse sentiment.</p>",

      "title": "Jim Cramer Is Fixated On An International Rotation",
      "content": "One of the world’s most prolific talking heads around the stock market, Jim Cramer needs little introduction in the financial world. The host of MAD MONEY on CNBC, Cramer, has been in the investing and media game for years, and for the most part, he’s got his pulse on the market better than most. Key Points Jim Cramer is taking a long, hard look at some European names that have been overlooked. His take is that Europe has been overlooked for too long, and some major brands are experiencing financial growth in the region. Camer wholeheartedly believes that ignoring Europe would mean ignoring financial gains. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) A continent with nearly 750 million people, Cramer believes this region of the world has been overlooked for far too long. Indicating that this region is on the rise, his take is that the state of Europe is very strong, something heavyweight giants like the CEO of Cisco support wholeheartedly. Europe Is Coming Back There is no question that Cramer, who believes Wall Street has overlooked Europe unnecessarily, is fixated on the region&#8217;s sudden rise and the belief that a host of companies are experiencing significant success. Cramer notes that there has been an increase in spending, particularly in the technology sector, across Europe. He highlights that even the telecom companies, which have generally been adverse to big spending in the region, are now opening up their wallets in a meaningful and impactful way. His concern is that Wall Street has ignored Europe for far too long. Still, Portugal, Italy, Spain, and numerous other countries in the European region are now directly on Cramer’s radar. Amazon (AMZN) When it comes to Amazon, Cramer specifically highlights that the company has been losing money in Europe for as long as he can remember. Now, the company has turned the corner, showing at least one billion in profit in the last quarter alone, just from European sales. He also thinks that the stock is on the rise, specifically because investors are seeing the growth potential in Europe. According to online research, Amazon has a market penetration of at least 64% in Germany and approximately 50% of the online market in Spain. This is before you turn your attention to France, where 35% of the spending shoppers do online goes to Amazon. In Italy, nearly 70% of all online spending is directed to Amazon, which further supports Jim’s point that Amazon is a must-watch stock in Europe. Apple (AAPL) When you consider that Apple saw a 10% increase in iPhone shipments in Europe in the first quarter of 2025, despite a worldwide decline, it’s another reason in favor of Cramer’s outlook on the company. This led to almost a billion dollars in profit for the first quarter, similar to Amazon&#8217;s, just in Europe. Cramer indicates that nobody saw this coming, and yet, it’s a telling sign that Apple is seeing these kinds of numbers in the market. Burberry (BURBY) Burberry, headquartered in London, recently announced that it was laying off 20% of its global workforce, but this didn’t stop its stock from jumping in response. On June 25, 2025, the company highlighted that Q1 sales were proof that its resilience in the market was no fluke. It also expects the first quarter of its 2026 financial year to outperform the fourth quarter of 2025, which boosts Cramer&#8217;s argument about these specific companies. Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) European telecom giant Deutsche Telekom is also back on the rise, especially in light of its recent signing a deal with NVIDIA to establish an AI cloud for European manufacturers in Germany. NVIDIA said it will supply at least 10,000 chips to be used in Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s data centers, which is a win for both companies and demonstrates that DT is no longer hesitant to invest significantly. Cramer specifically highlights this willingness to open its wallet as a reason to keep an eye on this stock. ASML (ASML) Another company on Cramer’s radar is ASML, a Dutch multinational corporation specializing in the semiconductor industry, which is poised for significant financial growth. The company is standing by its reduced forecast from a month ago, but Cramer doesn’t think anyone is properly paying attention to the stock. He says this is one to watch.

Wall Street anticipates an <strong>earnings per share (EPS) of $0.45</strong> and <strong>revenue of approximately $567.42 million</strong>. CODI operates by acquiring and managing a diverse portfolio of businesses, providing them with strategic guidance and financial support.</p>\n\n<p>The company is currently navigating through significant challenges. A key director, Gordon M. Burns, resigned from the board on June 7, 2025, due to other commitments. This resignation coincides with a sharp decline in CODI's stock price and a class-action lawsuit related to accounting irregularities at one of its portfolio companies, as highlighted by Hagens Berman.</p>\n\n<p>CODI's financial metrics reveal a complex picture. The company has a high <strong>price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 66.77</strong>, indicating that investors are paying a premium for its earnings. However, the <strong>price-to-sales ratio is low at 0.22</strong>, suggesting that the market values the company modestly relative to its sales. The <strong>enterprise value to sales ratio is 1.00</strong>, reflecting the company's total value compared to its sales.</p>\n\n<p>Despite these challenges, CODI maintains a strong liquidity position with a <strong>current ratio of 4.07</strong>, indicating it has ample current assets to cover its current liabilities. However, the <strong>enterprise value to operating cash flow ratio is negative at -32.48</strong>, which may signal difficulties in generating cash flow relative to its enterprise value. The <strong>debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.37</strong>, showing a significant reliance on debt to finance its assets.</p>\n\n<p>The ongoing class-action lawsuit, with a lead plaintiff deadline of July 8, 2025, adds further pressure on CODI. The lawsuit covers a class period from May 1, 2024, to May 7, 2025, and is linked to financial irregularities. Investors who have incurred significant losses are encouraged to report their losses, as the company grapples with these financial and legal challenges.</p>",

      "content": "Close Apple (AAPL) could turn to ChatGPT maker OpenAI or Anthropic for help after delays in the launch of its highly anticipated AI-enhanced Siri, Bloomberg reported Monday. The iPhone maker has held talks with both Anthropic and OpenAI about relying on their AI models instead of in-house technology, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. Siri can be used to access ChatGPT with some iPhone models. Significant delays have raised pressure on Apple to prove it can compete with other tech leaders on AI development. Anthropic declined to comment on the report. Apple and OpenAI did not respond to an Investopedia request for comment in time for publication. At Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference earlier this month, Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said the Siri features “need more time to reach our high quality bar” and that more information would be released “in the coming year.” Shares of Apple rose 2% to close just above $205 on Monday. The stock has lost nearly a fifth of its value in 2025 so far, making it the second-worst-performing member of the Magnificent Seven stocks this year after Tesla (TSLA).

Notably, take rates ranked low on advertisers’ priority list, suggesting TTD can sustain its pricing power as long as it maintains performance leadership.</p>\n<p>While Amazon’s DSP is gaining share for off-Amazon ad spend, Citi noted TTD is largely not the source of that share shift, with both platforms poised to benefit from expanding programmatic budgets. The analysts came away from the Cannes Lions advertising conference more positive on the macro backdrop, seeing improved ad spending trends in Q2 compared to earlier expectations when TTD issued guidance.</p>\n<p>Citi also sees strong connected TV (CTV) momentum and limited direct risk from Amazon DSP, underscoring confidence in TTD’s ability to continue capturing budget share. The firm has opened a 90-day positive catalyst watch on TTD shares heading into the Q2 print, expecting potential guidance and consensus estimate beats fueled by healthier spending trends.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s newly launched national carrier, Riyadh Air, made a major splash at the Paris Airshow by signing a deal to purchase 25 Airbus A350-1000 jets. The announcement, confirmed by Airbus on Monday, signals the startup&rsquo;s commitment to rapidly expanding its global fleet as it eyes ambitious growth targets.</p>\r\n<p>The agreement also includes options for an additional 25 aircraft, potentially doubling the deal&rsquo;s scope. The confirmed order is estimated to be worth $4.6 billion after standard aviation discounts, according to Cirium Ascend valuations.</p>\r\n<h2>Strategic Bet on Airbus Over Boeing</h2>\r\n<p>The move comes amid ongoing speculation that Riyadh Air would opt for Boeing&rsquo;s 777X as its flagship model. Industry watchers were surprised to see Airbus secure the deal, especially given Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s broader aviation ties with U.S. manufacturers.</p>\r\n<p>While Riyadh Air hasn&rsquo;t ruled out future Boeing purchases, this deal marks a strategic pivot toward European aircraft design and reliability. It also builds on a parallel order made at the same event by AviLease, a Saudi leasing firm that inked agreements for both Airbus passenger and freighter jets.</p>\r\n<h2>Impact on the Aviation Market</h2>\r\n<p>This sizable order places Riyadh Air among the fastest-scaling new entrants in global aviation. It&rsquo;s also a signal of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Vision 2030 plan in motion &mdash; aimed at transforming the Kingdom into a global logistics and tourism hub.</p>\r\n<p>To understand how this deal could influence aviation sector valuations or be reflected in broader industry trends, check the <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#industry-pe-ratio-market-overview\">Industry P/E Ratio API</a>, which provides P/E data across sectors, including aerospace and defense.</p>\r\n<h2>Financing, Future Deliveries, and Aviation Stock Outlook</h2>\r\n<p>The structure of the deal &mdash; with 25 additional aircraft as options &mdash; suggests financial prudence while leaving room for rapid scaling. Deliveries are expected to begin before the end of the decade, with Riyadh Air targeting premium international routes from its base in Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s capital.</p>\r\n<p>For updated financials and aircraft manufacturer performance (e.g., Airbus or Boeing), the <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#full-financial-as-reported-financial-statements\">Full Financial as Reported API</a> can offer granular insights into how such high-volume orders impact manufacturer revenue and backlog.</p>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\n<p>Riyadh Air&rsquo;s blockbuster order is more than just a fleet expansion &mdash; it&rsquo;s a geopolitical and strategic signal. With Airbus emerging victorious over Boeing in this round, and Saudi Arabia doubling down on aviation growth, the global aircraft order race just got a lot more competitive.</p>",
