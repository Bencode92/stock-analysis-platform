Despite this, Steel Dynamics' stock has de-rated alongside broader market weakness amid escalating trade tensions, creating what UBS views as a compelling entry point.</p>\n<p>While UBS anticipates a pullback in steel prices later in the year, it believes $800/ton HRC pricing is sustainable, even amid softening demand. This forecast is supported by import parity improvements and a steeper cost curve, both of which have strengthened throughout the year.</p>\n<p>Beyond pricing, UBS highlights Steel Dynamics’ organic growth pipeline, including around $1.2 billion in expected EBITDA contributions from its Sinton facility and aluminum operations. This growth, paired with substantial free cash flow potential—estimated at 10–14% yield by 2026–2028 (adjusted for buybacks), underpins a strong capital return profile.</p>\n<p>With earnings momentum building into Q2, room for upside if HRC spot prices hold, and a more attractive valuation, UBS sees this as an opportune time to gain exposure to Steel Dynamics' long-term growth and cash generation potential.</p>\n",
