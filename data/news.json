      "content": "<p class=\"\" data-start=\"77\" data-end=\"373\">Asian stocks struggled to find direction on Wednesday as investors adopted a cautious approach ahead of key tariff announcements from U.S. President Donald Trump. With market participants waiting for details on the forthcoming \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, trading remained subdued across the region.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"\" data-start=\"375\" data-end=\"402\">Cautious Trading in Asia</h2>\r\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"404\" data-end=\"735\">Early Asian trading saw U.S. stock futures remaining muted, a sign that investors are holding off major moves until further clarity on trade policies emerges. Although U.S. indices closed higher on Tuesday&mdash;with technology shares leading the gains&mdash;global investors are now looking east for potential volatility as tariff news looms.</p>\r\n<ul data-start=\"737\" data-end=\"1198\">\r\n<li class=\"\" data-start=\"737\" data-end=\"827\">\r\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"739\" data-end=\"827\"><strong data-start=\"739\" data-end=\"749\">Japan:</strong><br data-start=\"749\" data-end=\"752\" />The Nikkei 225 was largely muted on Wednesday, while the TOPIX lost 0.6%.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li class=\"\" data-start=\"828\" data-end=\"947\">\r\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"830\" data-end=\"947\"><strong data-start=\"830\" data-end=\"840\">China:</strong><br data-start=\"840\" data-end=\"843\" />The Shanghai Composite edged up by 0.2%, and the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 index was mostly unchanged.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li class=\"\" data-start=\"948\" data-end=\"1072\">\r\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"950\" data-end=\"1072\"><strong data-start=\"950\" data-end=\"978\">Hong Kong and Singapore:</strong><br data-start=\"978\" data-end=\"981\" />Hong Kong&rsquo;s Hang Seng index gained 0.4%, while Singapore&rsquo;s Straits Times Index fell 0.4%.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li class=\"\" data-start=\"1073\" data-end=\"1198\">\r\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"1075\" data-end=\"1198\"><strong data-start=\"1075\" data-end=\"1099\">Australia and India:</strong><br data-start=\"1099\" data-end=\"1102\" />Australia&rsquo;s S&amp;P/ASX 200 inched up by 0.2%, and India&rsquo;s Nifty 50 futures rose slightly by 0.2%.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 class=\"\" data-start=\"1200\" data-end=\"1226\">Awaiting Tariff Details</h2>\r\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"1228\" data-end=\"1665\">Market watchers are anticipating President Trump&rsquo;s tariff announcement on April 2 at 15:00 ET (19:00 GMT). The new tariffs&mdash;expected to be broad in scope&mdash;include a 25% levy on auto imports set to take effect on April 3. White House officials have indicated that these measures will be implemented immediately after the announcement, aiming to counteract trade imbalances by imposing reciprocal tariffs on a wide range of trading partners.</p>\r\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"1667\" data-end=\"1942\">U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has emphasized that this will be one of the most significant tariff measures introduced by the Trump administration. The uncertainty surrounding the specifics has led to a wait-and-see approach, with investors choosing caution over risk.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"\" data-start=\"1944\" data-end=\"1991\">Global Trade Dynamics and Investor Sentiment</h2>\r\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"1993\" data-end=\"2267\">The potential disruption to global trade dynamics from these tariffs has made investors wary. While some markets in the U.S. have already seen gains&mdash;particularly in the technology sector&mdash;the anticipation of more aggressive trade measures is weighing on sentiment worldwide.</p>\r\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"2269\" data-end=\"2517\">For a deeper look at how global economic trends and policy shifts might affect market performance, you can explore real-time data through the <a class=\"\" href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#economic-indicators\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"noopener\" data-start=\"2411\" data-end=\"2507\">Economic Indicators</a> endpoint.</p>\r\n<hr class=\"\" data-start=\"2519\" data-end=\"2522\" />",
