      "title": "Bernard Arnault’s Brilliant Advice for Anyone Dreaming of Retirement One Day",
      "content": "If one visits almost any medium to large sized mall around the globe, certain luxury brand name stores or products tend to dominate, such as: Louis Vuitton Kenzo Fendi Sephora Tiffany Christian Dior Givenchy Dom Perignom Bulgari Guerlain ….and numerous others. All of these luxury brands and about 65 others all have a few things in common: they are high demand, top-dollar price tagged, and are all owned by LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton SE (OTC: LVMUY), the Paris, France headquartered luxury conglomerate helmed by Bernard Arnault. Arnault’s savvy management and focus on high-end, top of the line products has catapulted him into multibillionaire status, with a net worth that fluctuates between rivalling and even exceeding that of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, based on the stock price of LVMH at any given time. Despite the vast differences in the types of companies they find attractive and demographics of their respective customer bases for those companies, Arnault and Buffett share a “buy and hold” long term investment strategy mindset, and investors can find useful applications for several of the underlying rationales for how Arnault invests, even without the billions at his disposal. Key Points Both Warren Buffett’s and Bernard Arnault’s investing successes are based on a “buy and hold” strategy, although Berkshire Hathaway and LVMH could not be more unlike as corporate entities. In terms of stock price appreciation, Berkshire Hathaway has appreciated 2,800% over 30 years (1993-2023), while in the same time period, LVMH grew 100,000%. Although Arnault acquires a controlling interest in most of his companies like Buffett, there are underlying principles and rationales for his selections, which individual investors can also learn from and utilize. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Optimistic In The Long Term; Pessimistic In The Short Term Tiffany&#8217;s renowned reputation for premium jewelry and artistic craftmanship made it a must-have brand for LVMH to acquire. Whereas Warren Buffett characteristically pursues conservative companies with solid earnings that are undervalued, Arnault is much more aggressive, preferring high growth potential companies with high quality products that have underachieved through poor management or marketing. By investing in new designs and marketing, Arnault believes true value will eventually be achieved. Additionally, whereas Buffett’s modus operandi is to buy companies at bargain levels as low as possible to offset risk, Arnault has no qualms about paying a premium to acquire control over highly desired brands that he can then escalate even further. Buffett’s approach concentrates much more on intrinsic value and earnings and eschews hype or popularity, and is focused on solidly established industries, such as consumer goods, insurance, railroads, food, and banking. This explains Berkshire Hathaway’s late involvement in investing in technology. Conversely, Arnault’s focus on the luxury goods sector has helped LVMH to nearly corner the market on certain top brand couture, perfumes, champagnes, and accessories. That said, Arnault values diversification with synergy, as he has also branched out into related sectors like media and technology, especially if they can contribute to increasing value for his other holdings. While Arnault’s approach is unequivocally higher risk, the returns have been stellar. In a 30 year stretch from 1993 to 2023, Berkshire Hathaway stock grew 2,800%. In that same period, although much more volatile. LVMH grew 100,000%. Investing Tips for Retirees Berard Arnault&#8217;s acquisition selection principles can easily be applied to stock choices for one&#8217;s retirement portfolio. Bernard Arnault’s acquisition strategies are multimillion-dollar or even billion-dollar affairs. However, the underlying rationale for most of his acquisition choices are predicated on principles that will work to build any portfolio, and is something that retirees may especially wish to consider incorporating for their own stock picks: Quality Over Quantity &#8211; Some investors, especially Baby Boomers, are intimidated by the high prices of certain stocks, especially when they reach triple digits. However, if the investment is part of a growth portfolio, even 5 or 10 shares of a Magnificent 7 stock, such as Apple or Microsoft, will likely fare better than 100 shares of a company with more marginal upside potential. Look For Innovation &#8211; Companies that are not trying to innovate or who go on autopilot instead of investing in R&amp;D, will likely become stagnant over the long haul. The ones who are pushing the envelope will have a stronger chance for a big breakthrough, Think Globally &#8211; Arnault’s luxury brands have universal appeal in practically all contemporary societies, throughout all of the developed nations and emerging nations, to even Communist societies, where LVMH goods like Louis Vuitton handbags fetch enormous sums on the black market. Companies that market to the world as opposed to only a limited local market have a greater chance for long-term massive growth. On the topic of retirement, Arnault clearly loves what he does. He has led LVMH for 35 years and had the company’s by-laws for retirement extended twice, first to 80, and then to 85, when he himself reached age 76. His other advice to potential retirees would likely be to avoid it if you love what you’re doing.

      "title": "France fines Apple €150 million over app tracking violations, EU probes follow",
      "content": "Apple has been hit with a €150 million ($162 million) fine by France’s competition authority over its App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, a move that adds pressure from multiple fronts as investigations in other EU countries gain traction. The penalty, announced on Monday, stems from how the iPhone maker rolled out the ATT feature, which critics argue undermines competition by limiting third-party advertising while boosting Apple’s own ad services.The fine reflects growing concern in the European Union about how dominant tech companies enforce privacy standards that may also act as commercial barriers. In Apple’s case, regulators found that ATT, introduced in 2021, unfairly impacted rival app developers and publishers by making user consent harder for third parties to obtain.ATT rollout triggers EU probesFrench regulators said Apple’s ATT rollout was neither necessary nor proportionate to the company’s stated goal of protecting user privacy. Although the tool asks users whether they want apps to track their activity across other apps and websites, the French Competition Authority found that the system was designed in a way that placed a heavier burden on third-party developers than on Apple itself.One major issue was the number of consent pop-ups users encountered. While third-party apps were required to display the ATT prompt, Apple’s own advertising services were integrated in a way that required less user effort to accept. Users had to opt out of ad tracking twice in Apple’s own settings, which the French watchdog said undermined the feature’s neutrality.Apple has also been ordered to publish the decision on its website for seven days, a standard measure in France for competition-related rulings.The French investigation originated from industry complaints filed in 2021. While emergency action was denied at the time, the regulator pursued a full-scale probe that has now led to financial penalties.Smaller publishers lose ad revenueIn its ruling, France’s authority emphasised the disproportionate economic impact ATT had on smaller app developers and ad service providers. These smaller players typically rely on third-party data collection for revenue generation through targeted advertising. Apple’s changes disrupted these practices, cutting off access to Apple&#8217;s Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) if users declined consent via the ATT prompt.This restriction effectively altered the dynamics of the mobile advertising market, where Apple&#8217;s rivals found themselves operating under stricter conditions. Apple, on the other hand, retained certain capabilities for its own ads within the App Store and other services.The competition body argued that ATT&#8217;s dual opt-out process placed unnecessary hurdles in front of users and made it more likely that they would remain in Apple&#8217;s ecosystem, giving the company an edge in the mobile ad space.Investigations spread to 4 countriesThe fine is part of broader scrutiny in Europe. Competition authorities in Germany, Italy, Romania, and Poland have each launched similar investigations into ATT, reflecting concerns that Apple may be favouring its own services in ways that violate local and EU-wide competition laws.These investigations focus not only on ATT’s technical implementation but also on the market power Apple holds through its control of iOS, the App Store, and user access to device-level data.While the French authority acted independently, any eventual findings from these additional countries could fuel coordinated EU action or raise the possibility of further fines and regulatory measures.Apple’s privacy tool under fireApple introduced ATT in April 2021 as part of iOS 14.5, presenting it as a privacy-focused feature aimed at giving users control over how apps track their online behaviour. The move was widely welcomed by privacy advocates, but triggered immediate backlash from advertisers and app developers.Since the rollout, Apple’s ad business has grown significantly, driven in part by increased reliance on the App Store’s native ad network. Critics argue that Apple’s design choices favour its own ecosystem while making it harder for competitors to maintain viable advertising models.Although the ATT framework technically applies to all apps, the French Competition Authority said Apple was not held to the same standard as others when it came to gaining user consent, thus violating the principle of fair access and harming competition.The post France fines Apple €150 million over app tracking violations, EU probes follow appeared first on Invezz",

      "title": "Donald Trump Campaigned on Cutting Corporate Taxes – Where Does That Promise Stand Today?",
      "content": "President Donald J. Trump’s 2024 electoral campaign was buoyed by the hope that his leadership would return the economic prosperity of his previous term, which had been decimated by Bidenomics and rampant Congressional spending, fueling inflation to the worst levels in 40 years. Central to President Trump’s strong economic performance from 2016-2020 was the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. TCHA resulted in unprecedented business growth, new entrepreneurism, historically low unemployment among all ethnic groups, and consumer confidence soaring to an 18-year high. The 21% corporate rate is one of the few permanent aspects to TCJA not subject to expiration. President Trump has been adamant about the need to renew TCJA, as other key provisions expire in December, 2025. He is also proposing additional tax cuts, such as taxes on overtime, tips, Social Security payments, and has even proposed eliminating federal income tax altogether, to be replaced with revenues from a national consumption tax and tariffs. However, analysts have debated the merits of further tax cuts, the impact on the national debt, and whether or not Congress would ultimately be able to legislate these proposals into law. Key Points The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) delivered unprecedented business growth and entrepreneurism, in addition to additional retained money in the pockets of a majority of American citizens. President Trump campaigned on cutting taxes further on a number of fronts, including renewal of TCJA before its expiration in December, 2025. Many analysts who have debated over the effectiveness of further tax cuts fail to include the massive regulatory cuts, the large pending reductions in wasteful spending being identified by DOGE, and the resultant job creation, business growth, and fresh investment into US business as a result of the tariff policies.

Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Arguments Against Tax Cuts and The Truth Senator Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is one of the main opponents to tax cuts and reduced spending that take away power from Democrats&#8217; pet projects. Not surprisingly, the entirety of elected Democrats, as well as left-leaning Republicans, have been the loudest voices against cutting taxes. Democrat leaders like Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have been among the more articulate critics, although their mantras about “tax cuts would only be for the top 1%” and that “the rich don’t pay their fair share” have been thoroughly debunked by genuine statistics and even left leaning Factcheck.org. In actuality, TCJA benefited over 75% of all US taxpayers, and it has been verified that the top 1%, in fact, pay 40% of the entirety of federal income tax. The Congressional Budget Office’s analysis projects that a TCJA extension would create increased deficits based on reduced tax revenues from present levels. It forecasts a $4.6 trillion shortfall over 10 years, accounting for interest on outstanding federal debt. The Tax Policy Center projected that economic growth would offset only 6% of the shortfall. One crucial point is that neither the CBO or TPC prognostications take into account any significant spending cuts nor how tariffs will accelerate cutting deficits, as well as other key policy ramifications already in effect in the Trump Administration: How tariffs are creating fresh US investment, new businesses, and more crucial private sector jobs. The impact of lower tax rates and the elimination of onerous Biden-imposed regulatory burdens are jump-starting new manufacturing and other major business creation. How ending potential trillions in fraudulent, misappropriated, and likely criminal spending waste from USAID and numerous other federal agencies uncovered by DOGE will accelerate the goal towards eliminating the trillions in federal debt overhang via drastically reduced spending. Why a national consumption tax effectively rebuts Democrat opponents’ claims of “unfairness” and “only favoring the rich”. Trump Fiscal Policy Results In The First 60+ Days Cutting the trillions of wasteful and criminal spending of taxpayer dollars uncovered by Elon Musk and DOGE could accelerate President Trump&#8217;s plans to fix the US economy and restore manufacturing and other critical businesses. Since taking office in January, the threat of Trump&#8217;s tariffs has already created a seismic shift in the corporate business environment. For example: In response to prospective 25% tariffs on products made in Taiwan, Taiwan Semiconductor, the maker of all of the GPUs from Nvidia and AMD required to run Artificial Intelligence, announced a $100 billion investment into new factories to be located in AZ for making GPUs and other semiconductor products expressly for the US market. SoftBank Group Corp. from Japan pledged to invest $50 billion in the US to create 50,000 new jobs. Apple announced it invested $500 billion for AI servers to be built in Michigan and Texas, creating 20,000 new jobs. Oracle, ChatGPT, and OpenAI announced its Stargate JV would invest up to $500 billion for AI infrastructure construction, creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs in various states, commencing with Texas. The revival of US-manufactured steel and copper is already underway, thanks to US tariffs to prevent dumping from China and other nations into the US market. Additionally, Elon Musk’s DOGE has been uncovering misappropriated taxpayer funds, payments to nonexistent recipients, and useless pork projects ostensibly designed to serve as political kickbacks and bribes to overseas entities, all of which are in the process of being cut. The anticipated spending cuts, something not factored into the CBO calculations, could drastically accelerate the rate of reducing the federal debt. A recent CBS poll found that 77% of the American public supports the work of DOGE. Lastly, a consumption tax, proposed as a 14-17% tax on all new goods except for food and medicine, would be a tax that visibly and unequivocally hits the wealthiest the hardest, thus debunking any accusations about unfairness. With no loopholes, a flat consumption tax is based on the value of the purchased item. Since expensive goods that are only affordable for the wealthy have a higher price tag, the commensurate tax revenues from those items will generate more tax revenues. President Trump was given a mandate by the electorate. While he has already enacted some of his plans to good effect, his tax and regulatory cutting proposals will still require much combating with Democrats, the predominant recipients of high taxes and big government spending. Over the next 4 years, the results of these battles will determine the extent of the initiatives’ full financial benefits.
