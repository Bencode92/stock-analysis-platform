[00:00:10] Doug McIntyre: And, Charlie Munger was on there giving dishing out advice. Warren Buffett&#8217;s partner, who&#8217;s I think been probably dead a year. but everybody in the industry has a favorite Charlie Munger quote or Warren Buffett quote. what are some of the Buffett quotes that you love? [00:00:29] Lee Jackson: Well, one of the favorite, and we often, include this when we write on Buffett, is his favorite holding time for an S&amp;P 500 stock is forever. [00:00:41] Lee Jackson: And as you and I both know, that&#8217;s the case with names that he&#8217;s had like Coca-Cola. And somebody American Express that he&#8217;s had for 10, 15, 20 years. And I always thought that was a great quote. My, my favorite holding time is forever. And I think one of the most interesting quotes recently, and he kind of stayed out. [00:01:04] Lee Jackson: He says even though he kind of tends to vote Democrat, he stays outta the political fray for the most part. But he started talking about tariffs, and he was basically getting into the whole point of tariffs are basically attacked and they&#8217;re just attacks on goods. And the quote that I loved when he goes the tooth fairy isn&#8217;t gonna pay that tax. [00:01:29] Lee Jackson: And I&#8217;m like, okay, probably not. But, when you have a guy like that who&#8217;s so widely followed and so widely recognized, as likely the greatest investor of the last 50 or 60 years, he is gonna be a quotable guy. We&#8217;ve constantly written about him. And the interesting thing for our viewers and of course our 24 7 readers, is that even though the markets have come back some from the lows, Berkshire Hathaway has been up all year long. And even when the markets were down at bare lows, 20% lows, it was still up 9% for the year. So, yeah, I think the best holding time is forever for an S&amp;P 500 stock. [00:02:15] Doug McIntyre: Well, one of the reasons I love that quote is. It&#8217;s because he likes stocks with a moats. There&#8217;s, when he goes into one of these stocks, I think the first thing he looks at, other than obviously earnings, is how hard is it for somebody else to get into this business? Right? Do you want try to compete with Coke from scratch? [00:02:38] Doug McIntyre: Impossible, absolutely impossible. American from scratch. A big oil company from scratch. Impossible. He held, he still holds Apple, but I mean, he bought a whole bunch of it. You wanna try to compete with Apple from scratch. He loves these companies where he knows that the chances that somebody can come in and compete with directly with him is very low. [00:03:04] Doug McIntyre: I mean, he&#8217;s in the railroad business. It used to be public now, he just decided he is gonna take the whole thing private. But it&#8217;s the same philosophy. Do you wanna try to compete with, are you gonna build the tracks, buy the engines, hire the answer is no. So my favorite Buffett quote, and I won&#8217;t get this exactly right, is every two years he sends out the managers of all of his companies a letter, and he says, it&#8217;s okay if you lose money. [00:03:33] Doug McIntyre: We can afford to lose money. Obviously I don&#8217;t want you to lose it forever. but we can&#8217;t afford to lose a shred of reputation. He said, I absolutely money that&#8217;s fixable. But the day, and he said, I wanna make sure that a fair but unfriendly reporter can do a story about us on the front of the Wall Street Journal and our reputation will be intact. [00:03:59] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. That&#8217;s another thing Buffett understands is that, and one of the great examples is Johnson and Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), when there was that scare about Advil. Right. Okay. That was a long time ago, but you remember, Burke, who was the CEO then took every single bottle off every single shelf of cattle in the country. [00:04:22] Doug McIntyre: And you talk about reputation protection, and I mean, that&#8217;s one of Buffett&#8217;s philosophies is its reputation. [00:04:31] Lee Jackson: Well, and I think, are you sure you don&#8217;t mean the Tylenol scare? Was it Tylenol or Advil? Tylenol. It was Tylenol, and at first you&#8217;re right about Advil, they did pull that a few years back on concerns over liver toxicity. [00:04:47] Lee Jackson: But the one you remember is when J&amp;J, Tylenol&#8217;s owned now by Kenvue, which was the spinoff in 23 from J&amp;J. But when that all happened, and gosh, that&#8217;s been 30, 40 years ago. Yeah, it was in the eighties, I think. But you&#8217;re right, they took every single bottle of Tylenol and it was all taken off the market because people died. And, yeah, that&#8217;s the way you save your rep. [00:05:16] Lee Jackson: And not that Johnson and Johnson hasn&#8217;t had enough issues with the baby powder and the talcum powder and all that stuff. They&#8217;re fixing to have to, they&#8217;re trying to get that settled out. [00:05:26] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. Anyway, Buffett number one, hold my stocks forever. Number two, reputation, [00:05:34] Lee Jackson: And number three, tariffs are nothing more than a tax, and they&#8217;re not paid for by the tooth fairy. [00:05:40] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. And the tax thing is absolutely right. The post Warren Buffett Sees Right Through Trump&#8217;s Tariffs appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Buy the Rumor 1:41 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Bank of America has issued a report advising investors to buy the trade deal anticipation but sell the news. BofA Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett wrote, &#8220;Oversold equities have correctly front-run Q2 trade deals/lower tariffs. We expect ‘buy the expectation, sell the fact,’ stocks fade into the trade deals.&#8221; The White House is expected to meet with China officials on potentially reaching a trade agreement over the weekend. Stocks remain lower out of caution. Markets Hold Back 12:09 pm by Gerelyn Terzo China&#8217;s government officials have come out swinging against the White House, saying they strongly opposes what they described as &#8220;U.S. abuse&#8221; of reciprocal tariffs. Earlier today, President Trump revealed that he was willing to reduce tariffs on China imports to 80% from a triple-digit percentage level. Washington, D.C. and Beijing officials are set to come to the negotiating table this weekend. Stocks are lower on the trade deal uncertainty. Markets Reverse Course 10:52 am by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market has reversed course, leaving all three of the major stock market averages in the red after coming out of the gate higher on China trade deal hopes. Traders and investors appear to be playing it cautiously until the White House and Beijing sign on the dotted line. Market declines are modest, including a 0.07% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. At this rate, stocks are likely to continue meandering between positive and negative ground for now. Weekly Performance 9:44 am by Gerelyn Terzo The Nasdaq Composite is on pace for a fractional gain today and has advanced a more impressive 7.9% over the past month. Year-to-date, the tech-heavy index is still lower by 6%. Over the past five trading sessions, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) has gained 5% while Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) has lost 7.4%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are looking to end the week on a positive note after getting some good news on the trade war. President Trump revealed that he is willing to slash tariffs on China imports from a triple-digit percentage to 80%, saying that level seems appropriate as the White House gears up for talks with Beijing. Stocks appear to be cautiously optimistic on the development, with all three of the major stock market averages headed higher this morning. While China has been the wildcard, the Trump administration suggested that multiple agreements are being reached with U.S. trade partners, injecting further optimism into these markets. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green, led by the energy, consumer discretionary and technology sectors. Magnificent Seven stocks are lifting the Nasdaq Composite higher, including a 1% gain in Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) and 2.5% jump in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also getting a pop from Boeing (NYSE: BA) stock on a strong Dreamliners jet order from the British Airways parent company. BA stock is up 1.4%. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 114.55 (+0.26%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 102.00 (+0.57%) S&amp;P 500: Up 24.36 (+0.41%) Market Movers Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) might be a volatile play, but that is what it takes to trade as one of the leading tech stocks. As of yesterday, Palantir has muscled its way into the top 10 most valuable technology plays in the U.S. market, boasting a market capitalization of $281.1 billion. By way of comparison, Salesforce&#8217;s (NYSE: CRM) market cap currently hovers at a lesser $268.4 billion. PLTR stock is down 1% today on profit taking. Ad-tech platform The Trade Desk (Nasdaq: TTD) is soaring 22.8% today after reporting strong Q1 results. Revenue ballooned by 25% to $616 million. Earlier this month, RBC maintained a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $85 per share, reflecting upside potential of 41%. Lyft (Nasdaq: LYFT) stock is rising today after lifting its Q2 forecast and initiating a $750 million share buyback program. Most Wall Street analysts have a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the stock. Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) is taking a breather after announcing a blockbuster deal to acquire options trading platform Deribit in a $2.9 billion deal, thrusting it into the crypto derivatives realm.

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Markets Hope Nvidia Will Lift Sentiment 1:51 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets are hoping Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) will revive sentiment next week, as the company prepares to release its highly anticipated Q1 results on Wednesday, May 28. Despite a 1% dip year-to-date in the share price, Nvidia&#8217;s underlying fundamentals remain robust based on its most recent performance. The company has the potential to shift the focus from tariffs back to earnings, which have largely beaten expectations so far. Most Wall Street analysts maintain a buy rating on NVDA stock, projecting an average 12-month price target of $164, a considerable upside from current levels of $132. Nvidia&#8217;s upcoming Q1 report is expected to shed light on the impact of tariffs implemented in early 2025. This follows strong Q4 results where the company surpassed Wall Street estimates on both revenue and earnings. At the time, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated, “AI is advancing at light speed as agentic AI and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries.” NVDA stock is currently off fractionally while the SPX ETF is off by 0.37%. Tariff Tall Tale 12:24 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Wedbush analyst Dan Ives pushed back against President Donald Trump&#8217;s new tariff targeting Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) iPhones, basically calling domestic production a tall tale. &#8220;We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the [U.S.] is a fairy tale that is not feasible,&#8221; Ives stated in a report. Trump threatened that Apple could face tariffs of 25% or more on iPhones made outside the USA. Apple recently revealed its intentions to redirect production of its iPhones from China to India. Apple stock is down 2.5% today, and the SPX ETF is lower by 0.84%. Fed Uncertainty 10:45 am by Gerelyn Terzo Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee cautioned Friday that President Donald Trump’s latest tariff moves have complicated monetary policy decisions and likely pushed back any interest rate changes. The Fed previously revealed its intentions to lower interest rates twice in 2025. Goolsbee told CNBC, &#8220;Everything’s always on the table. But I feel like the bar for me is a little higher for action in any direction while we’re waiting to get some clarity.&#8221; This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. A sharp sell-off gripped the markets this Friday morning, with all three major stock market averages surrendering ground. The week is set to conclude on a sour note, following President Trump’s recent threat to levy a steep 50% tariff on the EU, a measure that could be implemented in the coming days. In a potentially encouraging sign, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has trimmed its losses almost in half, while both the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 have similarly come off their worst levels. The majority of economic sectors are trading lower, with consumer discretionary and technology stocks taking the hardest hits. The SPX ETF is lower by 0.84%, while the S&amp;P 500 is on pace for a 2.7% weekly decline. Bond yields are declining as the trade war escalates, bringing a volatile week for the bond market to a close. Stock market volatility has also reemerged, highlighted by a 25% increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is facing renewed pressure, with President Trump warning that iPhones produced outside the U.S. could be subject to substantial tariffs, causing Apple stock to drop 2% today. Yet, in a bright spot among the Magnificent Seven, prominent Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is optimistic about Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), boosting his price target on the electric vehicle manufacturer to $500, suggesting a 49% upside potential, alongside an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 253.11 (-0.60%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 182.34 (-0.94%) S&amp;P 500: Down 44.23 (-0.77%) Market Movers Nuclear stocks are defying the downward trend today, gaining ground as the Trump administration signals favorable conditions for the industry. Companies including Oklo (NYSE: OKLO), NuScale (NYSE: SMR), and Constellation Energy (Nasdaq: CEG) are all advancing, led by a double-digit percentage gain for OKLO. Quantum computing stock IonQ (NYSE: IONQ), however, is down as much as 4.7% today, following yesterday&#8217;s rally that saw its share price close above $45. In earnings developments, Intuit (NYSE: INTU) is gaining 8.6% today while Deckers (NYSE: DECK) is sinking 21.7% on a Wall Street downgrade following disappointing results on tariff impacts.

      "title": "With Trillions Coming Into the United States One Investment Says ‘Buy’",
      "content": "A perfect storm of the greatest financial opportunities of our lifetimes may be before us, with unprecedented amounts of foreign capital, 18 trade deals in the final stages of negotiation, and upcoming tax cuts. Nearly $3 trillion of investment commitments in AI have been announced, which span a period of years. Oracle, NVIDIA, and Apple are major players, along with the UAE, Open AI, and Softbank.Risk is present from China producing less expensive or more powerful chips, or imposing trade restrictions that could greatly impact our tech companies. However, the US is striving to be the dominant world leader of AI, for which It does not take a genius to consider long term holds for Oracle, NVIDIA, and Apple. In the last 5 weeks NVIDIA has risen 23.6%, up from a low of 94, to 116. However, that is well under their 2025 highpoint of 149. Similarly, the 2025 high of Oracle was 186, but currently is 150, while Apple has dropped 61 points since the day after Christmas, and is now 198, down 23.5%. Although we may see some significant volatility with trade negotiations in the short term, for the coming years, I would expect the large domestic investments made by these key tech companies to produce excellent returns. Also, Taiwan Semiconductors is investing $100 billion for producing their chips here, and that stock is down over 21% in the last 2 ½ months. Likely this would also be a very good hold.What do AI data centers need? Electricity! By 2030, AI data centers are estimated to require 9% of total electricity usage in the United States, with overall demand for electricity projected to increase by 16%. AI data centers are planned for Texas, Louisiana, Ohio, North Carolina, and other areas, for which one might look at providers of electricity in those states. Oncor, that is owned by Sempra, is a major servicer of Texas. The parent company is one of the largest utility holding companies in the US, with current pricing of $75 per share, which is down from $87 in early January, and is paying a dividend of 3.4%. American Electric Power (AEP) is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, for which that stock is up almost 14% this year, and paying a current dividend yield of 3.54%. AEP exceeded analyst expectations of earnings per share by 8.1%, while Ohio is experiencing growth with favorable tax legislation. Several AI data centers are planned for south Florida, while Florida has experienced tremendous population growth, gaining nearly 2 million more residents since 2019. When speaking of electricity to power Florida, one might consider investments in Nexterra, that owns Florida Power and Light, the largest utility in the state, and has a dividend yield of 3.22%. I also am an advocate for Duke Energy, which is held by numerous pension funds. Duke is one of the three great universities of Research Triangle Park, along with the University of North Carolina and North Carolina State. This area of the country has one of the highest concentrations of PhD’s, for which Apple and others are investing in data centers in North Carolina. Duke Energy is up about 12% in 2025, which is excellent for a bit over 4 months, and has a dividend yield of 3.47%.An additional component for not only the construction of AI data centers, but for the expansion of many industries that will benefit from the huge investments being made in the US, is&#8230; infrastructure! This leads one to ETFs for materials. One might take a look at XLB, Vanguard Materials (VAW), and Invesco (PYZ).What is driving both foreign and domestic investment in the US, is the likely legislation of tax cuts, combined with no tariffs for producing goods in the United States. This is a one-two punch for an economic stimulus, along with 18 trade deals being in the stages of final negotiation, which hopefully will dramatically increase US production and exports.This is the first in a series of articles to capitalize on the trillions of dollars of investment commitments that have been announced in recent weeks, along with a multitude of trade deals and tax cut legislation that should be forthcoming. The phrase that comes to mind is that the best time is… NOW!I encourage the reader to do their own research, and to consult with a competent investment advisor.

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Bonds on Sale 1:19 pm The Treasury&#8217;s auction of 5-year notes has concluded. Paying 4% interest, the $70 billion in notes sold at an average yield of 4.07%, indicating a small 1.7% discount to face value. At the Right Price, Investors Still Love T-Bills 11:52 am $70 billion worth of 5-year Treasury notes are about to go on auction, and demand looks healthy even as yields rise. (Which makes sense. Higher yields imply lower prices, and everybody likes a bargain, even when we&#8217;re talking about U.S. government debt). 2-year Treasuries went on sale yesterday, and demand was described similarly as &#8220;solid.&#8221; The Dow is still down 0.3%. Apple and iPhones in Focus 11:17 am Dow component company Apple (Nasdaq: APPL) is in focus today as Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah reiterates a hold rating and $215 price target on the tech stock. &#8220;Tariff actions&#8221; are pulling demand for iPhones forward into the March and June quarters as investors hedge against the risk President Trump is serious about imposing 25% tariffs on imported iPhones. Further out, the analyst is looking ahead to the expected iPhone 17 launch. Apple has raised its estimates for iPhone 17 shipments in Q4, and iPhone average selling prices are also moving higher. Apple stock is up about 0.5% today. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average has turned red, now down 0.3%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. President Trump alarmed investors last week when he threatened to impose a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union as early as June 1. On Monday, the President backtracked, saying the tariffs won&#8217;t actually go into effect until July 9. Even more optimistically, he confirmed efforts are afoot to &#8220;quickly establish meeting dates&#8221; with EU negotiators to lower tariff barriers and &#8220;open up the European Nations for Trade with the United States of America.&#8221; In more troubling news, there&#8217;s trouble brewing at the White House today as Elon Musk, who spearheaded President Trump&#8217;s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts, says he&#8217;s &#8220;disappointed&#8221; with &#8220;the massive spending bill&#8221; that the President sent to Congress last week, and that the House of Representatives has now passed. The bill, says Musk, &#8220;increases the budget deficit&#8221; and &#8220;undermines the work that the Doge team is doing.&#8221; Not good. Nevertheless, after soaring 700 points yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) is up another 65 points today for a nearly 0.2 % gain. Earnings Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (NYSE: ANF) reported an earnings beat today, $1.59 per share earned in Q1, which was $0.20 better than expected. The retail clothing chain stock is up nearly 27% currently. Macy&#8217;s (NYSE: M) &#8220;beat earnings by a penny,&#8221; reporting $0.16 per share in Q1 profit. Macy&#8217;s stock is down almost 4%. Both companies cut guidance after reporting their beats. Abercrombie predicts it will earn between $9.50 and $10.50 this year. Macy&#8217;s says full year earnings will range from $1.60 to $2. Both earnings ranges are broadly below analyst forecasts, implying no more earnings beats this year. Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods (NYSE: DKS) meanwhile reported $3.37 per share this morning. The number beat analyst forecasts. Even better, guidance at Dick&#8217;s calls for $13.80 to $14.40 per share earned this year. At the midpoint, that&#8217;s less than Wall Street&#8217;s forecast $14.34, but the &#8220;$14.40&#8221; number at least implies there&#8217;s a chance Dick&#8217;s will beat estimates this year.

In a related move, OpenAI is reportedly entrusting its creative and design leadership to Ive and his design firm, LoveFrom. Ive, widely recognized as the visionary behind the iPhone, alongside OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, will focus on crafting consumer devices and other projects that aim to shape the future look and feel of artificial intelligence. NFLX Stock Clinches New All-Time High Despite Analyst Downgrade 11:45 am by Gerelyn Terzo Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX) stock is rising 1.5% today to above $1,200 per share for a market cap of $514.3 billion, clinching a fresh all-time high. JPMorgan analysts are sending mixed messages, downgrading NFLX shares to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;overweight&#8221; but raising the price target to $1,220 per share, reflecting about 1% upside potential from current levels. The SPY ETF is currently down by 0.18%. UnitedHealth Woes Grow 10:30 am by Gerelyn Terzo UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) stock is experiencing a further decline today, dropping 4.3% and adding to its recent struggles. Analysts at HSBC recently downgraded the healthcare giant, citing earnings risks and suggesting that any recovery for the battered stock could be &#8220;delayed.&#8221; This follows the company&#8217;s CEO stepping down in recent weeks. CFRA was an early mover, downgrading UNH shares to a &#8220;sell&#8221; back in Q1 and sounding an early warning on the stock. Overall, UNH stock has fallen 39.3% year-to-date. The SPY ETF remains under pressure and is down 0.51% at last check. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Markets are widening their losses today, with all three major stock market averages trading lower right out of the gate. Bond yields are on the rise, pushing the 30-year Treasury yield past the 5% mark. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is sinking by over 300 points, while both the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are each shedding approximately 0.55%. The SPY ETF trading lower by 0.45%. Bucking the downward trend, Google parent company Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) stands out, climbing 1.8% today. The tech giant, currently hosting its I/O developer event in California, has showcased new innovations like Android XR glasses and real-time translation in Google Meets, and hinted at a paid subscription tier for AI users. Meanwhile, Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang expressed approval for the Trump administration&#8217;s updated curbs on AI chip exports to China. Discount retailer Target (NYSE: TGT) delivered disappointing quarterly results, including a 2.8% slide in sales. The retailer further lowered its full-year outlook, attributing the cautious forecast to consumer uncertainty surrounding tariffs, and is now bracing for a low single-digit sales decline for the current fiscal year. Consequently, Target&#8217;s stock is losing 6.8% today. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 345.16 (-0.81%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 38.21 (-0.20%) S&amp;P 500: Down 30.26 (-0.51%) Market Movers Retailers are on the move. TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX), parent of brands like TJ Maxx, managed to surpass Wall Street&#8217;s sales estimates but opted to keep its full-year guidance unchanged. TJX appears to be benefiting from the current economic climate as consumers adjust spending habits and increasingly opt for lower-priced brand items. In other individual stock movements, Palo Alto Networks (Nasdaq: PANW) is down 6.9% today following its Q3 results. Despite this, Morningstar analysts suggest the cybersecurity firm is gaining significant market share. Super Micro Computer (Nasdaq: SMCI) is advancing 2.7% as the company weighs investing in a U.S. expansion. Fair Isaac Corp (NYSE: FICO) has plunged 11% today after a federal housing official raised questions about its pricing model. This comes in a significant week for the housing sector, with key existing and new home sales data anticipated later.

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Jamie Dimon on the Risk of Inflation and Deflation 3:23 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets have recouped most of their losses, with the SPX now down a modest 0.03%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon believes the risks around the threat of both inflation and deflation have yet to surface in stock market values.

According to Dalio, the credit agency&#8217;s analysis fails to account for the inherent risk of the federal government resorting to money printing to service its massive debt. While Treasury yields rise, the markets remain under pressure, including a 0.17% decline in the SPX ETF. Retail Stocks in Focus 10:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo This week, the market&#8217;s focus pivots to corporate earnings, with reports due from major players like Home Depot (NYSE: HD), Target (NYSE: TGT) and TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX). Notably, TJX stock has already climbed 11% this year so far. Comparable store sales figures will be under close examination amid ongoing high interest rates as well as signs of cooling inflation. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are narrowing their declines in the face of a U.S. debt downgrade by one of the credit rating agencies. Moody&#8217;s lowered its view of U.S. debt by a single notch to to Aa1, down from the highest possible rating. Moody&#8217;s blamed the persistent budget deficit and high interest rates, a view challenged by President Trump, who affirmed global confidence in the U.S. economy. The credit downgrade adds insult to injury following a week in which the S&amp;P 500 advanced 5%. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC he predicts one interest rate cut in 2025 as the economy continues to stave off a recession. The central bank has tipped its hand to a possible two rate cuts this year. Today&#8217;s credit downgrade sent Treasury yields higher, with the 30-year Treasury surpassing the 5% threshold, and weighed heavily on equities. While the SPX ETF is currently down slightly, the three major averages are showing signs of resilience, paring back their earlier losses as the morning progresses. The broader technology sector is currently down 1.4%. The prominent Magnificent Seven stocks are mostly in the red, including a 2.8% decline in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny of its proposed AI partnership with China&#8217;s Alibaba. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 44.18 (-0.10%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 103.54 (-0.54%) S&amp;P 500: Down 20.36 (-0.34%) Market Movers Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is down 2.3% after announcing potential price increases due to tariffs, a move countered by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent&#8217;s suggestion that the retailer will &#8220;absorb some of the tariffs.&#8221; Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) has seen a 3.8% decline but remains close to its recent high of $130.18. Novavax (Nasdaq: NVAX) is a significant gainer, soaring 25.9% following regulatory approval for its COVID-19 vaccine. Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) shares are lower by 4.4% on the back of an analyst downgrade. Take-Two Interactive Software (Nasdaq: TTWO) is bucking the trend, climbing 3.7% after a price target increase from Wedbush Securities.

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Trade Deals 3:06 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly revealed that the U.S. has secured one trade deal, keeping most of the details close to the vest except to say that the White House is awaiting a green light from some unnamed country. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 300 points in response for a 0.84% gain, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are holding similar gains. Narrow Range 12:34 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets are managing slight gains across the Nasdaq Composite, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average despite the absence of greater details on any global trade deals. Of the S&amp;P 500, Baird investment strategist Ross Mayfield is cited by CNBC as saying, “I think [stocks are] probably trapped in a in a pretty tight range here,&#8221; pointing to a range of 5,100-5,700. “I think we can bounce around there for quite a while in kind of some volatile, choppy trading. Until we get some resolution on the trade front, I don’t think much else matters,&#8221; he added. Consumer Weakness 11:03 am by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market averages are currently all moving higher despite some weaker than anticipated economic data. The U.S. consumer has long been credited with upholding the economy throughout the one-two punch of inflation and higher interest rates. Now the tariffs could be the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back, as consumer confidence shows signs of waning. The Consumer Confidence Index published by the Conference Board sank to a reading of 86 in April, a drop of nearly 8 points from the prior month and below economist estimates calling for 87.7. A separate index that reflects consumer sentiment over the next six months fell by a steep 12.5 points to a reading of 54.4, its worst level in over a decade. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that March job postings dropped to their lowest level in about six months. Tariffs, Earnings and Tech 10:00 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets continue to trade mixed this morning on tariff deal ambiguity as Q1 earnings results pour in. Stocks are weighing earnings results and a lack of certainty on the tariff deal front while tensions have emerged between Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) and the White House over tariff-related costs. Magnificent Seven stocks are mixed, with Amazon and Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) trading in the red while Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) benefits from a Wall Street endorsement. Hims &amp; Hers HEalth (Nasdaq: HIMS) is soaring by 24% today on news of a deal to sell weight loss drug phenom Wegovy on its e-commerce platform. The markets are holding out for more tariff deal progress, digging in their heels and nearly standing still in the meantime. The three major stock market averages are moving fractionally in either direction, with the Nasdaq Composite posting slight declines alongside the S&amp;P 500 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is eking out modest gains. Sectors of the economy are evenly split between red and green, with real estate moving higher and consumer discretionary stocks headed lower. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) is getting some unwanted attention after the White House took aim at the tech giant, calling its reported plans to list tariff cost impacts on its site as a &#8220;hostile and political act.&#8221; Big 3 automaker General Motors (NYSE: GM) reported better-than-expected quarterly results while reassessing its full-year outlook, sending the stock lower by 1.5%. GM and the auto sector have targets on their backs at the height of the tariff wars, in response to which the former Dow component has suspended all share buyback programs. The White House has affirmed its plans to provide tariff relief to the auto sector. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 138.11 (+0.36%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 67.15 (-0.40%) S&amp;P 500: Down 10.23 (-0.19%) Earnings &amp; Analyst Calls Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) surpassed Q1 expectations on the top and bottom lines and is keeping its full-year guidance intact amid expectations that it will be able to manage any tariff-related fallout, including rising aluminum costs. Rival company PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) recently lowered its earnings forecast due to the tariff impact. Evercore ISI has reiterated its &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock with a $250 price target, suggesting the company&#8217;s strategies should help it to offset any impact from the tariff frenzy. Piper Sandler has reiterated its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA), saying that the China tariff uncertainties notwithstanding, the AI leader&#8217;s strong market relationships give the stock a place in the analyst firm&#8217;s top large cap pick universe. UBS has reiterated its &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) but lowered the price target to $253 from $272, owing to what it described as &#8220;potential demand destruction.&#8221; The post Live Nasdaq Composite: Markets Stand Still on Tariff and Tech Tussle appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Markets Pivot to Ford Earnings 4:03 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets failed to turn around, ending the trading session lower across the board and ending a multi-session winning streak. Stocks are awaiting further details on trade deals, which the White House has revealed could come as soon as this week, which would not be soon enough for the markets. Ford (NYSE: F) stock fell just over 1% on the day ahead of the automaker&#8217;s quarterly results after the closing bell today. When fellow automaker General Motors (NYSE: GM) reported its quarterly results last month, the company withdrew its profit guidance due to tariff uncertainty. Here&#8217;s how the major indices finished the trading day: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 69.52 (-0.17%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 132.40 (-0.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 36.79 (-0.66%) Economic Uncertainty 12:32 pm by Gerelyn Terzo U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is making the rounds, speaking to global investors today about President Trump&#8217;s economic plan. He pointed to a three-pronged approach, including tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation. Bessent&#8217;s remarks failed to provide any greater clarity on the status of tariff negotiations with key U.S. trade partners, leaving the markets at a standstill. The three major stock market averages remain mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average moving higher while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite remain lower. Winners and Losers 10:43 am by Gerelyn Terzo Airline stock Delta (NYSE: DAL) is gaining 3% on the day, while United Airlines (Nasdaq: UAL) is tacking on 2.7%. EQT (NYSE: EQT) is advancing by 2.9% on the day on the heels of a dividend announcement. Ralph Lauren (NYSE: RL) is up 2.8%. Tyson Foods (NYSE: TSN) is losing 9.6% today on a quarterly revenue miss. Zimmer Biomet (NYSE: ZBH) is also down 9%. In what is proving to be a volatile session on Wall Street, the markets have come off their lows of the session. The markets are coming off the heels of a nine-day winning streak and have come out of the gate with plenty of headlines to process, chief among which has been the announced retirement of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett. Wall Street firm TD Cowen has issued a report suggesting that price increases from tariffs will be reflected in May&#8217;s inflation data. The Federal Reserve gathers this week to determine the near-term outlook on interest rates while the markets will also be paying close attention to the tone in comments from Chairman Jerome Powell. First-quarter earnings continues to unfold as names like Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR), Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and Diamondback Energy (Nasdaq: FANG) take the spotlight. Mag Seven stocks are a mixed bag as shares of Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) extend their losses with a 2% decline today. Sectors of the economy were originally all lower but industrials and telecom stocks have since made their way into the green. Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX) shares are lower after President Trump tossed in fresh tariffs on foreign-made films. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 50.53 (-0.12%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 133.34 (-0.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 32.82 (-0.58%) Market Movers Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) is down 6% but maintains a $1.1 trillion market cap as Buffett prepares to pass the reins to his successor Greg Abel at the end of the year. Footwear stock Skechers (NYSE: SKX) has decided to leave the publicly traded markets behind and has accepted a private equity takeover by 3G Capital for $63 per share, sending the stock higher by 25% percentage today. Jefferies maintains a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), suggesting the valuation has already given the stock the benefit of the doubt in areas like tech innovation and scalability. Mizuho analysts are bullish on Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE), lifting shares to an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating from &#8220;neutral&#8221; on an attractive risk/reward profile and sending the stock 3.5% higher today.

Year-to-date, the broader market index has fallen approximately 3%. &#039;Jet Fuel&#039; for Stocks 12:07 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Now that the Fed decided to leave interest rates unchanged for the time being, the White House has clapped back. President Trump expressed disappointment in Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for failing to follow in the footsteps of other countries by lowering interest rates in the economic slowdown, saying that a rate cut could be jet fuel to stocks. Nevertheless, the markets are holding onto gains, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 each up over 1% as further trade details between the U.S. and the U.K. emerge. Also, the bitcoin price is hovering back above the $100,000 level on news of a deal involving crypto exchange Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN).

The markets are breathing a sigh of relief on positive trade developments. President Trump revealed a &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; trade agreement between the U.S. and the U.K., giving the major stock market averages a catalyst for gains as buying activity picks up.

      "title": "Live Nasdaq Composite: Fear Grips Markets as Investor Sentiment Shifts Yet Again",
      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Ford in Focus 3:55 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets finished the day the way that it started &#8211; lower -putting an end to a multi-day winning streak. Now the markets are gearing up to process quarterly earnings results from Ford (NYSE: F), whose stock fell 1.2% during regular market hours. Automakers have had a target on their backs for tariffs, and the markets will be looking for greater clarity on any impacts in Ford&#8217;s performance. Here&#8217;s how the major indices finished the day: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 69.52 (-0.17%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 132.40 (-0.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 36.79 (-0.66%) America First Economy 12:38 pm by Gerelyn Terzo U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is speaking at the Milken conference today, addressing global investors about President Trump&#8217;s economic agenda. As part of his America First vision, President Trump is looking to make the U.S. economy more appealing to investors amid a strategy involving tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation &#8211; oh my. While the markets await further details on trade talk progress, the three major stock market averages are mixed, including a slight gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite remain lower. Tariff Uncertainty Remains 11:36 am by Gerelyn Terzo The Dow Jones Industrial Average has turned higher, managing a 7-point gain after starting the session in the red. Meanwhile, technology stocks continue to weigh on the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500. According to TD Cowen, tariff-related price hikes are set to rear their heads in May&#8217;s inflation print. Much of the tariff damage will unfold in the summer months as lower-priced inventories dwindle at businesses. The firm says consumers are between a rock and a hard place as tariff-related costs trickle down to them, a situation exacerbated by higher shipping costs. Selling Eases 10:04 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure this morning but are off their lowest levels of the session. Netflix (Nasdaq; NFLX) shares are off about 2% on the day after last week&#8217;s rally. ON Semi (Nasdaq: ON) is falling 8% on the day after reporting its Q1 results, while industry peer Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is gaining 2%. Here&#8217;s a look at where things stand with the broader market averages: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 53.67 (-0.16%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 97.38 (-0.55%) S&amp;P 500: Down 30.46 (-0.52%) After a week of gains, fear has settled into the markets once again amid a bevy of catalysts. In addition to earnings, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell set to comment on the economy this week, suggesting it could be yet another roller coaster ride for investors. First-quarter earnings season continues to roll on, with names like Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) as well as Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and Diamondback Energy (Nasdaq: FANG) on the docket in the coming days. All three of the major stock market averages are trading in the red out of the gate, including a 1% decline in the Nasdaq Composite. Mag Seven stocks are mixed while the sell-off continues to unfold in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) shares, with a 2% decline today. All sectors of the economy are currently lower, the most severe of which is happening in energy stocks, which are down 2% this morning as the oil price continues its descent. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) has reached the end of an era now that billionaire Warren Buffett announced his retirement after six decades at the helm. With $300 million in cash on the sidelines, BRK-B is losing 6% on the day for a market cap of $1.09 trillion. Greg Abel will succeed Buffett at year-end 2025. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 196.82 (-0.49%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 175.23 (-1.03%) S&amp;P 500: Down 52.04 (-0.88%) Market Movers Footwear company Skechers (NYSE: SKX) is going private, agreeing to a private equity takeover by 3G Capital in a deal that values the company at $63 per share, sending the stock higher by a double-digit percentage today. Jefferies has reiterated its &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), suggesting the valuation has already given the stock the benefit of the doubt in areas like tech innovation and scalability. Mizuho analysts like Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE), upgrading shares to an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating from &#8220;neutral&#8221; on an attractive risk/reward profile. The stock is up 3.5% today.
