      "content": "A perfect storm of the greatest financial opportunities of our lifetimes may be before us, with unprecedented amounts of foreign capital, 18 trade deals in the final stages of negotiation, and upcoming tax cuts. Nearly $3 trillion of investment commitments in AI have been announced, which span a period of years. Oracle, NVIDIA, and Apple are major players, along with the UAE, Open AI, and Softbank.Risk is present from China producing less expensive or more powerful chips, or imposing trade restrictions that could greatly impact our tech companies. However, the US is striving to be the dominant world leader of AI, for which It does not take a genius to consider long term holds for Oracle, NVIDIA, and Apple. In the last 5 weeks NVIDIA has risen 23.6%, up from a low of 94, to 116. However, that is well under their 2025 highpoint of 149. Similarly, the 2025 high of Oracle was 186, but currently is 150, while Apple has dropped 61 points since the day after Christmas, and is now 198, down 23.5%. Although we may see some significant volatility with trade negotiations in the short term, for the coming years, I would expect the large domestic investments made by these key tech companies to produce excellent returns. Also, Taiwan Semiconductors is investing $100 billion for producing their chips here, and that stock is down over 21% in the last 2 ½ months. Likely this would also be a very good hold.What do AI data centers need? Electricity! By 2030, AI data centers are estimated to require 9% of total electricity usage in the United States, with overall demand for electricity projected to increase by 16%. AI data centers are planned for Texas, Louisiana, Ohio, North Carolina, and other areas, for which one might look at providers of electricity in those states. Oncor, that is owned by Sempra, is a major servicer of Texas. The parent company is one of the largest utility holding companies in the US, with current pricing of $75 per share, which is down from $87 in early January, and is paying a dividend of 3.4%. American Electric Power (AEP) is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, for which that stock is up almost 14% this year, and paying a current dividend yield of 3.54%. AEP exceeded analyst expectations of earnings per share by 8.1%, while Ohio is experiencing growth with favorable tax legislation. Several AI data centers are planned for south Florida, while Florida has experienced tremendous population growth, gaining nearly 2 million more residents since 2019. When speaking of electricity to power Florida, one might consider investments in Nexterra, that owns Florida Power and Light, the largest utility in the state, and has a dividend yield of 3.22%. I also am an advocate for Duke Energy, which is held by numerous pension funds. Duke is one of the three great universities of Research Triangle Park, along with the University of North Carolina and North Carolina State. This area of the country has one of the highest concentrations of PhD’s, for which Apple and others are investing in data centers in North Carolina. Duke Energy is up about 12% in 2025, which is excellent for a bit over 4 months, and has a dividend yield of 3.47%.An additional component for not only the construction of AI data centers, but for the expansion of many industries that will benefit from the huge investments being made in the US, is&#8230; infrastructure! This leads one to ETFs for materials. One might take a look at XLB, Vanguard Materials (VAW), and Invesco (PYZ).What is driving both foreign and domestic investment in the US, is the likely legislation of tax cuts, combined with no tariffs for producing goods in the United States. This is a one-two punch for an economic stimulus, along with 18 trade deals being in the stages of final negotiation, which hopefully will dramatically increase US production and exports.This is the first in a series of articles to capitalize on the trillions of dollars of investment commitments that have been announced in recent weeks, along with a multitude of trade deals and tax cut legislation that should be forthcoming. The phrase that comes to mind is that the best time is… NOW!I encourage the reader to do their own research, and to consult with a competent investment advisor.

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Interest Rate Cuts in Flux 9:56 am by Gerelyn Terzo Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee stated Friday that President Donald Trump&#8217;s recent tariff actions have thrown a wrench into monetary policy likely delaying any adjustments to interest rates. He told CNBC: &#8220;Everything’s always on the table. But I feel like the bar for me is a little higher for action in any direction while we’re waiting to get some clarity.&#8221; This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are in freefall on Friday, with all three of the major stock market averages lower by at least 1%. The markets are poised to end the week on a negative note after President Trump threatened to impose a steep 50% tariff on the EU, which could take effect in the coming days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is reeling by over 400 points, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are similarly down 1% today. Most sectors of the economy are trading lower, with the worst declines seen in consumer discretionary and technology stocks. Treasury yields are falling as the trade war reignites, capping off a roller coaster week for the bond market. Volatility has also returned to the stock market, as evidenced by a 25% increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). Additionally, Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) has a target on its back after President Trump also cautioned that iPhones made outside of the U.S. could be subject to heavy tariffs. Apple stock is down 2% today. In a bright spot for the Magnificent Seven stocks, influential Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is bullish on Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), lifting his price target on the EV maker to $500, reflecting 49% upside potential, with an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating attached. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 400.50 (-0.96%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 309.43 (-1.6%) S&amp;P 500: Down 66.80 (-1.1%) Market Movers Nuclear stocks are bucking the downward trend today and gaining ground as the Trump administration looks to implement favorable conditions for the industry. Stocks including Oklo (NYSE: OKLO), NuScale (NYSE: SMR) and Constellation Energy (Nasdaq: CEG) are all advancing today, led by a double-digit percentage gain for OKLO. Quantum computing stock IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) fell as much as 4.7% today, following yesterday&#8217;s rally that saw the share price close above $45.

      "title": "Dow Jones Live Update May 28: Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) Opens Higher",
      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Bonds on Sale 1:19 pm The Treasury&#8217;s auction of 5-year notes has concluded. Paying 4% interest, the $70 billion in notes sold at an average yield of 4.07%, indicating a small 1.7% discount to face value. At the Right Price, Investors Still Love T-Bills 11:52 am $70 billion worth of 5-year Treasury notes are about to go on auction, and demand looks healthy even as yields rise. (Which makes sense. Higher yields imply lower prices, and everybody likes a bargain, even when we&#8217;re talking about U.S. government debt). 2-year Treasuries went on sale yesterday, and demand was described similarly as &#8220;solid.&#8221; The Dow is still down 0.3%. Apple and iPhones in Focus 11:17 am Dow component company Apple (Nasdaq: APPL) is in focus today as Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah reiterates a hold rating and $215 price target on the tech stock. &#8220;Tariff actions&#8221; are pulling demand for iPhones forward into the March and June quarters as investors hedge against the risk President Trump is serious about imposing 25% tariffs on imported iPhones. Further out, the analyst is looking ahead to the expected iPhone 17 launch. Apple has raised its estimates for iPhone 17 shipments in Q4, and iPhone average selling prices are also moving higher. Apple stock is up about 0.5% today. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average has turned red, now down 0.3%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. President Trump alarmed investors last week when he threatened to impose a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union as early as June 1. On Monday, the President backtracked, saying the tariffs won&#8217;t actually go into effect until July 9. Even more optimistically, he confirmed efforts are afoot to &#8220;quickly establish meeting dates&#8221; with EU negotiators to lower tariff barriers and &#8220;open up the European Nations for Trade with the United States of America.&#8221; In more troubling news, there&#8217;s trouble brewing at the White House today as Elon Musk, who spearheaded President Trump&#8217;s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts, says he&#8217;s &#8220;disappointed&#8221; with &#8220;the massive spending bill&#8221; that the President sent to Congress last week, and that the House of Representatives has now passed. The bill, says Musk, &#8220;increases the budget deficit&#8221; and &#8220;undermines the work that the Doge team is doing.&#8221; Not good. Nevertheless, after soaring 700 points yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) is up another 65 points today for a nearly 0.2 % gain. Earnings Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (NYSE: ANF) reported an earnings beat today, $1.59 per share earned in Q1, which was $0.20 better than expected. The retail clothing chain stock is up nearly 27% currently. Macy&#8217;s (NYSE: M) &#8220;beat earnings by a penny,&#8221; reporting $0.16 per share in Q1 profit. Macy&#8217;s stock is down almost 4%. Both companies cut guidance after reporting their beats. Abercrombie predicts it will earn between $9.50 and $10.50 this year. Macy&#8217;s says full year earnings will range from $1.60 to $2. Both earnings ranges are broadly below analyst forecasts, implying no more earnings beats this year. Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods (NYSE: DKS) meanwhile reported $3.37 per share this morning. The number beat analyst forecasts. Even better, guidance at Dick&#8217;s calls for $13.80 to $14.40 per share earned this year. At the midpoint, that&#8217;s less than Wall Street&#8217;s forecast $14.34, but the &#8220;$14.40&#8221; number at least implies there&#8217;s a chance Dick&#8217;s will beat estimates this year.

NFLX Stock Clinches New All-Time High Despite Analyst Downgrade 11:45 am by Gerelyn Terzo Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX) stock is rising 1.5% today to above $1,200 per share for a market cap of $514.3 billion, clinching a fresh all-time high. JPMorgan analysts are sending mixed messages, downgrading NFLX shares to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;overweight&#8221; but raising the price target to $1,220 per share, reflecting about 1% upside potential from current levels. The SPY ETF is currently down by 0.18%. UnitedHealth Woes Grow 10:30 am by Gerelyn Terzo UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) stock is experiencing a further decline today, dropping 4.3% and adding to its recent struggles. Analysts at HSBC recently downgraded the healthcare giant, citing earnings risks and suggesting that any recovery for the battered stock could be &#8220;delayed.&#8221; This follows the company&#8217;s CEO stepping down in recent weeks. CFRA was an early mover, downgrading UNH shares to a &#8220;sell&#8221; back in Q1 and sounding an early warning on the stock. Overall, UNH stock has fallen 39.3% year-to-date. The SPY ETF remains under pressure and is down 0.51% at last check. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Markets are widening their losses today, with all three major stock market averages trading lower right out of the gate. Bond yields are on the rise, pushing the 30-year Treasury yield past the 5% mark. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is sinking by over 300 points, while both the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are each shedding approximately 0.55%. The SPY ETF trading lower by 0.45%. Bucking the downward trend, Google parent company Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) stands out, climbing 1.8% today. The tech giant, currently hosting its I/O developer event in California, has showcased new innovations like Android XR glasses and real-time translation in Google Meets, and hinted at a paid subscription tier for AI users. Meanwhile, Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang expressed approval for the Trump administration&#8217;s updated curbs on AI chip exports to China. Discount retailer Target (NYSE: TGT) delivered disappointing quarterly results, including a 2.8% slide in sales. The retailer further lowered its full-year outlook, attributing the cautious forecast to consumer uncertainty surrounding tariffs, and is now bracing for a low single-digit sales decline for the current fiscal year. Consequently, Target&#8217;s stock is losing 6.8% today. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 345.16 (-0.81%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 38.21 (-0.20%) S&amp;P 500: Down 30.26 (-0.51%) Market Movers Retailers are on the move. TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX), parent of brands like TJ Maxx, managed to surpass Wall Street&#8217;s sales estimates but opted to keep its full-year guidance unchanged. TJX appears to be benefiting from the current economic climate as consumers adjust spending habits and increasingly opt for lower-priced brand items. In other individual stock movements, Palo Alto Networks (Nasdaq: PANW) is down 6.9% today following its Q3 results. Despite this, Morningstar analysts suggest the cybersecurity firm is gaining significant market share. Super Micro Computer (Nasdaq: SMCI) is advancing 2.7% as the company weighs investing in a U.S. expansion. Fair Isaac Corp (NYSE: FICO) has plunged 11% today after a federal housing official raised questions about its pricing model. This comes in a significant week for the housing sector, with key existing and new home sales data anticipated later.

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Jamie Dimon on the Risk of Inflation and Deflation 3:23 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets have recouped most of their losses, with the SPX now down a modest 0.03%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon believes the risks around the threat of both inflation and deflation have yet to surface in stock market values. He said at an event in New York, “We have huge deficits; we have what I consider almost complacent central banks. You all think they can manage all this. I don’t think” they can&#8230;“My own view is people feel pretty good because you haven’t [yet] seen effective tariffs&#8230;The market came down 10%, [it’s] back up 10%; that’s an extraordinary amount of complacency.&#8221; Ray Dalio Comments on US Debt 11:58 am by Gerelyn Terzo Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, reportedly raised a flag that Moody&#8217;s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating misses a crucial point regarding the vulnerability of U.S. Treasuries. According to Dalio, the credit agency&#8217;s analysis fails to account for the inherent risk of the federal government resorting to money printing to service its massive debt. While Treasury yields rise, the markets remain under pressure, including a 0.17% decline in the SPX ETF. Retail Stocks in Focus 10:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo This week, the market&#8217;s focus pivots to corporate earnings, with reports due from major players like Home Depot (NYSE: HD), Target (NYSE: TGT) and TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX). Notably, TJX stock has already climbed 11% this year so far. Comparable store sales figures will be under close examination amid ongoing high interest rates as well as signs of cooling inflation. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are narrowing their declines in the face of a U.S. debt downgrade by one of the credit rating agencies. Moody&#8217;s lowered its view of U.S. debt by a single notch to to Aa1, down from the highest possible rating. Moody&#8217;s blamed the persistent budget deficit and high interest rates, a view challenged by President Trump, who affirmed global confidence in the U.S. economy. The credit downgrade adds insult to injury following a week in which the S&amp;P 500 advanced 5%. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC he predicts one interest rate cut in 2025 as the economy continues to stave off a recession. The central bank has tipped its hand to a possible two rate cuts this year. Today&#8217;s credit downgrade sent Treasury yields higher, with the 30-year Treasury surpassing the 5% threshold, and weighed heavily on equities. While the SPX ETF is currently down slightly, the three major averages are showing signs of resilience, paring back their earlier losses as the morning progresses. The broader technology sector is currently down 1.4%. The prominent Magnificent Seven stocks are mostly in the red, including a 2.8% decline in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny of its proposed AI partnership with China&#8217;s Alibaba. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 44.18 (-0.10%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 103.54 (-0.54%) S&amp;P 500: Down 20.36 (-0.34%) Market Movers Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is down 2.3% after announcing potential price increases due to tariffs, a move countered by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent&#8217;s suggestion that the retailer will &#8220;absorb some of the tariffs.&#8221; Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) has seen a 3.8% decline but remains close to its recent high of $130.18. Novavax (Nasdaq: NVAX) is a significant gainer, soaring 25.9% following regulatory approval for its COVID-19 vaccine. Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) shares are lower by 4.4% on the back of an analyst downgrade. Take-Two Interactive Software (Nasdaq: TTWO) is bucking the trend, climbing 3.7% after a price target increase from Wedbush Securities.

      "title": "3 Best Inverse ETFs to Profit in a Market Crash",
      "content": "Key Points The SH and PSQ ETFs provide simple inverse exposure to major U.S. market indexes. For bearish-leaning risk takers, the SPXS ETF offers powerful leverage when the S&amp;P 500 declines. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) The first quarter of this year reminded optimistic investors that stocks don&#8217;t only go up. Trade war tensions, recession worries, and other factors could spur a market crash in 2025. Instead of using fancy strategies like short-selling stocks or buying put options, there&#8217;s an easier way that doesn&#8217;t require a margin account. Bearish-leaning investors can profit from a stock market crash of 20% or more by owning inverse exchange traded funds (ETFs). These funds are specifically designed to gain value when a stock market index, such as the S&amp;P 500 or the NASDAQ 100, goes down. There are risks involved, to be sure, but the following three inverse ETFs could set you up for powerful returns if the market craters. ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 (SH) The S&amp;P 500 is a commonly cited stock index that represents a broad selection of large-cap U.S.-focused companies. Therefore, a simple way to profit from a stock market crash would be to hold an inverse ETF that gains value when the S&amp;P 500 collapses. ProShares offers an ETF that serves this exact purpose. It&#8217;s a fund called the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SH), and it seeks to move inversely to the daily performance of the S&amp;P 500. What&#8217;s good about moving inversely to the S&amp;P 500 is that it&#8217;s usually a slower-moving index than the NASDAQ 100. Therefore, the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF should carry less risk than some other inverse ETFs. Remember, the S&amp;P 500 comprises a broad range of stocks from multiple market sectors. Some S&amp;P 500 component stocks include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), Abbvie (NYSE:ABBV), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM). Thus, you&#8217;re actually achieving what I call &#8220;inverse diversification&#8221; with the SH ETF. Even with the somewhat de-risking effect of &#8220;inverse diversification,&#8221; the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF could gain value quickly if there&#8217;s a stock market crash. Be aware, though, that the SH ETF won&#8217;t necessarily move up at the exact same pace that the S&amp;P 500 goes down. That&#8217;s because the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF inversely tracks the S&amp;P 500 throughout the day but then resets and rebalances the next day. As ProShares explains, &#8220;For any holding period other than a day, your return may be higher or lower than the Daily Target [i.e., the S&amp;P 500]. These differences may be significant.&#8221; To put it another way, you&#8217;ll get faithful inverse S&amp;P 500 tracking for a day with the SH ETF. However, the longer you hold the fund, the more the results can vary from what you might expect. Consequently, while the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF would probably make you money during a market crash, it&#8217;s not meant to be held for too long. ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ) If you&#8217;re willing to accept more risk, consider that the NASDAQ 100 mostly covers only one market sector (technology) and only includes around 100 stocks (as opposed to around 500 stocks in the more diversified S&amp;P 500). So, an ETF that inversely tracks the NASDAQ 100 is somewhat riskier but could yield greater rewards in the event of a market crash. To that end, you might consider the ProShares Short QQQ ETF (NYSEARCA:PSQ). This fund inversely corresponds to the daily performance of the NASDAQ 100 index. Bear in mind that the NASDAQ 100 is mainly focused on technology sector stocks, such as Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). You won&#8217;t get as much &#8220;inverse diversification&#8221; with the ProShares Short QQQ ETF as you would get with the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF, but you could potentially achieve greater returns during a market crash with the PSQ ETF. Much like with the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF, the ProShares Short QQQ ETF is subject to unexpected results if you hold the fund for longer than a day. Hence, I&#8217;ll send out a similar warning: even if the stock market is collapsing, don&#8217;t hold the PSQ ETF for too long because the risks will probably increase over time. Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF (SPXS) My third entry for the best inverse ETFs to profit in a market crash is the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:SPXS). This, like the SH ETF, may be somewhat de-risked because it inversely tracks the S&amp;P 500 and has &#8220;inverse diversification.&#8221; However, the SPXS ETF is still the riskiest fund on this list. What makes the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF so high-risk and potentially high-reward is that the fund is inverse and triple-leveraged. This means that the SPXS ETF, on a daily basis, moves three times as fast as the S&amp;P 500, but in the opposite direction. In theory, you might assume that the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF would go up 60% if the S&amp;P 500 goes down 20%. Again, however, there&#8217;s no assurance of faithful index tracking beyond one day. Hence, you could get highly unexpected results if you hold the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF for a long time. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s probably too risky to hold the SPXS ETF for more than a couple of weeks, even during a stock market crash. Besides, if the stock market suddenly rallies, the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF could make a triple-magnified move to the downside. The point is that the SPXS ETF is for nimble, sniper-like traders who can get into and out of a position quickly. If you prefer to take on less risk, consider the non-leveraged ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF or ProShares Short QQQ ETF.The post 3 Best Inverse ETFs to Profit in a Market Crash appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

      "content": "Jensen Huang, who arguably runs the world&#8217;s most successful company, made only $1.5 million last year, according to the Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) proxy (PRE 14A). That is up $1 million from the year before. That pay was so low because most of his compensation comes from stock awards and “nonincentive compensation,” which can vary. In other words, the $1.5 million was all he could count on. It was his first base salary increase in a decade. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Last year, Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) Jensen Huang had his first base salary increase in a decade. Low compensation is not usually for CEOs who run the world’s most valuable companies. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Huang has a net worth of $98 billion, which makes him the 17th richest person in the world. Nvidia’s stock is down this year, so that figure has dropped $16 billion since January 1. Nvidia is the third most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of $2.7 trillion. The stock has dropped 17% so far this year. Most of Huang’s compensation for the recently reported year came from a stock award of $38 million. The problem with that award is that, if Nvidia’s stock drops, that sum could go down as well. Huang owns 3.5% of the company he founded in 1993. He turned it from a graphic chip company into the largest artificial intelligence (AI) company in the world. Huang’s low compensation is not usually for CEOs who run the world’s most valuable companies. Warren Buffett’s cash compensation last year was only $100,000. Because of his ownership in Berkshire Hathaway, his net worth is $166 billion, which makes him the sixth richest person in the world. From 1997 to 2011 when Steve Jobs retired as Apple’s CEO, his base cash compensation was only $1. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO today, had a base cash salary of $3 million last year. The low base salaries of highly successful CEOs are hard to explain. Do they tell investors that their pay is tied almost completely to performance? Or are they saying that to their employees? Huang and his board did not say.
