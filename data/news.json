While Johnson & Johnson has not yet officially responded to the ruling, an update from the company is expected soon to outline its next legal steps.</p>\n<p>Despite the setback, TD Cowen remains confident in the stock’s outlook, pointing to JNJ’s pre-established $11.6 billion reserve for the talc settlement—based on a total nominal value of $13.5 billion. This existing reserve cushions the financial impact and signals that the company has already absorbed much of the potential downside.</p>\n<p>The analysts also noted that investors have navigated similar disappointments in two previous failed settlement attempts, suggesting that any near-term weakness in the stock should be modest and short-lived.</p>\n<p>With strong fundamentals across its core pharmaceutical and medtech businesses, TD Cowen believes Johnson & Johnson remains well-positioned for long-term performance, even as the talc litigation continues to unfold.</p>\n",
