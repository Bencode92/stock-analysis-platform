Those fines are now gone under the new bill, removing a key revenue stream.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>EV tax credit loss</strong>: The removal of the <strong>$7,500 tax credit</strong> could weaken U.S. EV demand after a temporary Q3 boost. Lower Q4 sales, <strong>reduced factory utilization</strong>, and <strong>pricing concessions</strong> may follow.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>William Blair said the combination could threaten Tesla&rsquo;s margin resilience, noting that <strong>regulatory credits accounted for 16% of Tesla&rsquo;s gross profit</strong> last year.</p>\r\n<h3>Political Distraction Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Musk&rsquo;s July 4th launch of the <strong>&ldquo;America Party&rdquo;</strong> is also drawing criticism. Analysts believe it could be a <strong>major distraction</strong> during a period when Tesla must execute cleanly on autonomous initiatives and demand stabilization.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Related Data to Track:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Tesla&rsquo;s full financials, including regulatory credits</strong><br />🔗 <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#full-financial-as-reported-financial-statements\">Full Financials &ndash; Tesla (FMP API)</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Company rating breakdown and outlook trends</strong><br />🔗 <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#company-rating-company-information\">Company Rating &ndash; Tesla (FMP API)</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>🧭 Outlook</h3>\r\n<p>With Q3 possibly seeing <strong>front-loaded demand</strong>, the real test will come in Q4. Markets will monitor how much of Tesla&rsquo;s margin strength remains once <strong>policy tailwinds fade</strong> and <strong>regulatory arbitrage disappears</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Would you like this turned into a Twitter/X thread, SEO blog, or LinkedIn brief?</p>",

      "title": "“My Plan to Transition to Living Off Dividends Before Retirement”",
      "content": "For many people, there isn&#8217;t a ton of familiarity with dividends, even though they can be a critical part of a portfolio strategy. If you happen to visit r/dividends on Reddit, you will see and learn all about how both retirees and those looking for passive income are making dividends work for them in any number of ways. Key Points There is a lot of movement shifting toward relying on dividends for passive income during retirement. There is a big question about how much of a yield percentage you really want and need for dividend income. A whole subreddit is dedicated to the subject of dividends giving a lot advice. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) In the case of one Redditor, who is yet another poster in r/dividends, there is an important question about how retirees are making dividend income work. For this individual, they want to be well-prepared with a strategy before leaving the workforce, and as someone who is primarily a growth investor, they want to learn everything. The Current Portfolio This Redditor makes it perfectly clear that they have long considered themselves a growth investor. As a result, their current portfolio spread only has around 20% of investments focused on dividends, while the rest is focused more on growth. They are currently earning only around a 2% annual dividend yield on their total portfolio, a figure they aim to increase as they approach retirement. The goal is to be heavily focused on dividends as an income strategy for retirement, and the Redditor is asking others in the subreddit how they are breaking up their portfolios to accomplish something similar. As a reminder, a dividend yield is a ratio that indicates how much a company pays out in dividends each year to its stock price. Other Redditors Respond It won&#8217;t come as any surprise to learn that other Redditors who visit r/dividends regularly started chiming in with their thoughts quickly. Unsurprisingly, the top-ranked comment in the Redditor&#8217;s post was almost spot on with what this individual needed to hear. Based on their holdings, they have a strong account that includes both dividend-paying stocks and growth stocks, such as Google, Amazon, Apple, NVIDIA, and others. Additionally, there are nearly two dozen dividend growth and income stocks to help create this portfolio. The thing is, this Redditor isn’t alone, as many different responses in this post highlight purchases like SPYI, JEPI, QQQI, SPYH, QQQH, and many others. If you spend even a few minutes searching through this comment section and other posts in the sub, you&#8217;ll find that these are pretty standard holdings among those living off dividends or using these investments as dividend income right now. Additionally, other individuals claim to earn around $50,000 per year in dividend income, which is precisely what the original poster wanted to hear. This commenter highlighted their desire to reach around $150,000 annually, a not impossible amount of money if they have enough capital to buy the right number of shares. The Best Advice The best advice for this Redditor is to increase their dividend investments as they approach retirement age gradually. First things first, they need to know exactly what kind of income they are looking to earn annually and then work backwards to start picking out a portfolio. From here, they can also consider ETFs that prioritize dividends, creating a reliable income stream that can be used as a source of income during retirement. If the Redditor does go down this road, which sounds likely based on their comments, they simply need to regularly monitor their portfolio to ensure the yield stays in line with their income and retirement needs. Unfortunately, unlike investing directly in growth stocks, dividend yields as income are not a set-it-and-forget-it kind of thing. Instead, you have to rebalance the portfolio as needed to ensure you are getting what you need. The Redditor will also need to consider how to handle any tax implications related to the dividend income, alongside other income sources, including Social Security and capital gains.

      "title": "I’m 55 with $2.5 million in Apple stock- can I use these capital gains for the first 5 years of my retirement?",
      "content": "Planning for retirement is a complicated process that can take years to wrap your head around. Having millions of dollars in stock is incredibly fortunate, but it also poses some hard-to-answer questions. One Reddit user shared his situation: he is 55 years old and has owned Apple stock for 30 years, which is now worth $2.5 million. He would like to sell and use these funds for his retirement. The predicament is that doing so will result in significant tax payments and may raise his Medicare premiums. We are all aware that the higher an individual’s Modified Adjusted Gross Income, the higher one must pay in taxes. Because capital gains count towards MAGI, these funds can bump you into a higher tax bracket. This tax is unavoidable; however, there are certain strategies that can help reduce the financial stress. This slideshow presents several different options for how retirees can approach the burdens associated with capital gains, including tax-loss harvesting, Qualified Opportunity Funds, and donor-advised funds. These methods can minimize taxes and maximize retirement income. We explore how smart financial planning can give you peace of mind and protect your future. A Good Problem to Have: Capital Gains Dilemma A 55-year-old investor holds $2.5 million in Apple stock bought 30 years ago. Most of the value is in capital gains, raising tax concerns for retirement. What Are MAGI and Capital Gains? Selling appreciated stock increases Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI). A higher MAGI can push retirees into higher tax brackets and Medicare premiums. 2025 Capital Gains Tax Brackets Long-term capital gains tax rates are 0%, 15%, or 20%, based on filing status. For singles, 0% applies up to $48,350; for joint filers, up to $96,700. Impact on Medicare Costs Higher MAGI triggers IRMAA, increasing Medicare Part B and D premiums. Avoiding sudden large gains can help remain under IRMAA thresholds. Strategy 1: Spread Out the Gains Sell shares gradually over several years to manage taxable income. Spreading gains can help avoid higher tax and Medicare brackets. Strategy 2: Giving to Charities Donating appreciated stock to a donor-advised fund reduces taxable income. This strategy supports causes while minimizing tax burden. Strategy 3: Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts Early IRA withdrawals or Roth conversions can offset future taxes. Balancing withdrawals with stock sales can reduce overall tax impact. Strategy 4: Use Qualified Opportunity Funds Reinvesting in a Qualified Opportunity Fund can defer taxes. These funds often invest in real estate or development zones. Strategy 5: Consider RMDs Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) begin at age 73. Planning ahead ensures smoother income and lower tax rates later. Creating a Tax Strategy The best mix of strategies depends on the retiree’s goals and timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor ensures the right approach.

      "title": "Remplir sales surge: Orthocell CEO interview",
      "content": "Orthocell Ltd CEO and managing director Paul Anderson earlier this week spoke with Proactive after the company reported record revenue for the June 2025 quarter, citing strong uptake of its flagship Remplir nerve repair product. Highlights The company said quarterly revenue reached A$2.73 million, representing a 22.80 percent increase compared to the previous quarter. Orthocell highlighted that this growth reflected continued adoption across Australia, with more than 206 surgeons now using Remplir in over 166 hospitals. Anderson told investors that the commercial launch in Australia has been a “spectacular” success. The company noted that none of the reported revenue was generated in the United States, where it recently completed its first procedure. Orthocell said it has established a distribution network in the US, comprising 14 distributors and more than 100 representatives across 21 states. The company expects this infrastructure will drive further growth as the product is adopted by additional hospitals and surgeons. Anderson stated that preparations over the past two years have positioned the company to scale internationally. He said, “It leaves us in such a strong position,” adding that the lessons learned in Australia will inform the US commercial rollout. Potential catalysts for investors include increased US revenue contributions, further hospital engagements, and broader clinical use of Remplir. Orthocell also expects rising adoption rates in Australia to continue contributing to revenue momentum over the coming financial year. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL, ETR:APC) continues to show strength in its Services business, with global App Store revenue estimated to have increased by 12% year-over-year in June, according to Bank of America analysts. The firm maintains its ‘Buy’ rating on Apple and $235 price target, pointing to strong capital returns, leadership in on-device AI, and ongoing revenue diversification within the App Store. Bank of America estimates App Store revenues reached $8.4 billion in fiscal Q3 2025, up 11.5% year-over-year, based on developer-level data from SensorTower. Downloads across iPhone and iPad rose 4.3% year-over-year to 8.6 billion in the quarter, with dollars per download increasing to $0.98, a 6.9% improvement. “For the month of June, App Store revenue increased 12% year-over-year globally, outpacing app store download growth of 3% year-over-year,” analysts noted. Despite regulatory scrutiny and the Epic Games ruling, Bank of America analysts say there's no evidence of a material impact to App Store monetization. “We do not observe any indication of adverse impact on app store revenue,” they wrote, even as trends toward off-app payments become more common. The bank believes investor concerns around the ruling’s severity “appear to be moot.” The report also highlights a notable shift in App Store revenue mix, with gaming losing ground to other categories. While games still generate the largest share of revenue, their portion has dropped from over 50% to 45% in fiscal Q3. “Games remain as the leader of the global app store revenue by category list, though their share has declined,” the analysts wrote. Categories such as Photo & Video, Lifestyle, Books, Education, and Utilities each gained 100 basis points year-over-year, while Productivity jumped 200 basis points, the largest gain of any group. “This mix shift, albeit not as meaningful currently, may signal legacy game developers to diversify into non-games or expand existing in-app purchasing options,” Bank of America wrote. “We believe either scenario in the ensuing years could be a long-term tailwind for Apple’s App Store revenue.” Additionally, the top 10 developers globally now account for nearly a quarter of Apple’s year-to-date App Store revenue, according to the firm’s analysis. This group includes both single-app players like ChatGPT, FUNFLY, and Tinder, as well as diversified developers like Tencent, Google, and TikTok, which maintain broad app portfolios spanning entertainment, utilities, and productivity. Impact of US-Vietnam trade deal Meanwhile, proposed tariffs on goods exported from Vietnam into the US will have a minimal impact on Apple, analysts at UBS believe. While Vietnam has become an increasingly important part of the tech giant’s supply chain diversification strategy, the analysts highlighted that the region still accounts for only a small fraction, roughly 5%, of Apple’s global supply chain footprint. “Given the relatively small physical footprint and focus on ancillary products, a 20% tariff on imports into the US will have a negligible impact on Apple margins in our view,” they wrote. They see the financial impact as a “gross margin rounding error.” UBS estimates that approximately 35 Apple suppliers operate around 38 discrete facilities in Vietnam, concentrated in areas like Bac Giang, Bac Ninh, Hai Phong, Phu Tho, and Vinh Phuc. In comparison, mainland China still dominates the supply chain, representing over 35% of Apple’s supplier locations globally. UBS has a ‘Neutral’ rating and $210 price target on Apple, based on about 28 times their calendar year 2026 earnings per share (EPS) estimate, reflecting a higher equity risk premium and interest rates. “We note our financial projections reflect the impact of the proposed tariffs in the June quarter but not beyond given the fluid nature of the discussions,” they wrote. Shares of Apple finished Thursday’s trading session at about $213.",

      "title": "Why the Nifty 50 is Better Than the S&P 500",
      "content": "Among major market indices, the S&amp;P 500 is the go-to index for the broader stock market. It represents 500 of the top companies that trade in the stock market based on their market capitalizations. But on a global scale, the S&amp;P 500 isn&#8217;t the only game in town and arguably could take a page out of India&#8217;s comparable index — the Nifty 50 — for even better results. Indian stocks have several tailwinds, including rising investments into the Southeast Asian region. Last year thrust the Nifty 50 into the spotlight when it began beating the S&amp;P 500 on returns, and now investors are wondering if they might be missing out. It&#8217;s not that the S&amp;P 500 has a poor track record. It has gained a reputation as the go-to index for market exposure, comparisons and ETF tracking. It&#8217;s components set the standard for quarterly earnings performance, dividends and returns. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 carries more than three-quarters of the total stock market&#8217;s value, and it is held by investors big and small either through direct exposure or investment funds. We&#8217;re talking about high-flying names like NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), to name a few. Over the five-year stretch leading up to 2024, the S&amp;P 500 delivered average yearly returns of 13.6%, or 8.9% adjusted for inflation. While it&#8217;s nothing to balk at, India&#8217;s market has growth on its side. India&#8217;s Nifty 50 is a younger, more nimble index that has the ability to do things that a larger index in a greater economy is not in a position to easily replicate. With names like Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank and Tata Consultancy, the Southeast Asian index has a great deal of growth to offer investors. Key Points in This Article: Emerging economies present tremendous upside potential as American equities face unprecedented uncertainty. One analysis suggests a return of nearly 700% for the Nifty 50 index in dollar terms vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 321% over the past 25 years. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Nifty 50 Mechanics Serving as India’s premier stock market index, the Nifty 50 is the cornerstone benchmark for the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Its function is similar to that of the S&amp;P 500 in the U.S., acting as a measure of the Indian equity market’s overall performance while also reflecting investor sentiment. Since its debut in the mid-1990s, India&#8217;s index has tracked the performance of 50 of the biggest and most actively traded Indian companies on the NSE. Performance It feels counterintuitive to bet against the U.S. stock market, so that is not the purpose of this argument. Nevertheless, the Nifty 50 has had an impressive run of late. Over the past couple of decades, the Nifty 50 has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in certain analyses. While a basic comparison might be influenced by currency fluctuations, studies that adjust for the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar reveal the Nifty 50 delivering higher returns than the U.S. index. One analysis, in particular, suggests a return of nearly 700% for the Nifty 50 index in dollar terms vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 321% over the past 25 years. Much of this outperformance has unfolded over the past five years or so while India&#8217;s GDP has been expanding quickly amid policy support as well as domestic and international investment, which has widened the gap dramatically. For investors seeking to capitalize on a rapidly expanding economy, the Nifty 50 has arguably been a more compelling vehicle. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s important to note that the Indian economy is coming from a lower base than that of the U.S. economy and therefore also carries with it greater risk. The U.S. economy is valued at $27.7 trillion compared with India&#8217;s GDP of approximately $3.6 trillion. Smaller Cohort Secondly, you can argue that the Nifty 50 offers a more focused, high-quality play on India&#8217;s elite corporate sector. As an index of only 50 companies, it represents only the biggest and most liquid companies on the National Stock Exchange. This makes it a useful benchmark for investors who want exposure to India’s blue-chip leaders. These include stable, leading players in key sectors like financial services, technology and energy. For a new investor in the Indian market, this smaller, more focused list can be easier to understand and follow. Lower Base Finally, while the S&amp;P 500 represents a mature, developed market, the Nifty 50 is a direct bet on a still-developing economy with a GDP that is growing by leaps and bounds. This offers the potential for greater growth. Despite some of the volatility that comes with emerging market status, the Nifty 50 is seen as a key indicator of India’s economic health, and its performance has reflected the country’s strong growth of late. This combination of stability among its top companies and exposure to a high-growth economy makes for a compelling investment thesis.

      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Apple Stock Bump 11:10 am by Gerelyn Terzo Bank of America analysts have reaffirmed their &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock, pointing to the App Store results as a positive catalyst. Earlier this week, Jefferies analysts lifted their outlook on Apple shares to &#8220;hold&#8221; from &#8220;underperform.&#8221; Apple stock is up 0.78% today but is down 14% year-to-date. Fed in Focus 9:58 am by Gerelyn Terzo With today&#8217;s strong jobs data, indicating a healthy economy, Wall Street analysts are predicting what to expect when Fed policymakers convene next. Here&#8217;s a roundup of some of the commentary: BMO&#8217;s Ian Lyngen remarked, “Overall, it was a strong set of data that implies the Fed will remain on hold later this month, leaving rate cut expectations focused on the September FOMC meeting.” Mutual of America Capital Management CEO Joe Gaffoglio wrote, “The June jobs report continues to demonstrate resilience across the labor market, even as certain sectors such as manufacturing continue to lag. The unemployment rate is holding steady at 4.1%, and real average hourly earnings for employees experienced its largest increase of the year.” Goldman Sachs&#8217; Head of Fixed Income Macro Strategies Simon Dangoor commented: “Today’s stronger jobs report confirms a still resilient U.S. labor market, defying, at least for now, the signs of weakness seen in some leading indicators. The FOMC’s conviction that it should hold its wait-and-see stance while it braces for an acceleration in inflation over the summer will only be strengthened. But we still see a path to a resumption of the Fed’s easing cycle later in the year should the summer acceleration in inflation prove more modest than expected.” This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are celebrating a stronger-than-expected jobs report for June, sending all three of the major stock market indices higher. The economy added 147,000 payrolls last month, far outpacing economist forecasts calling for a slowdown in hiring. Meanwhile, past data was revised upward, while the unemployment rate dropped from 4.2% to 4.1%, once again outshining most expectations. The Nasdaq Composite is on pace for yet another record high, as is the broader S&amp;P 500 market index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.28%. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green today, led by telecom, consumer discretionary and technology. Big Tech is driving much of the gains in the Nasdaq Composite today, including a 2% rise in Meta Technologies (Nasdaq: META) amid an analyst upgrade at Needham, which has assigned a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the stock, up from &#8220;underperform.&#8221; Elon Musk weighed in on X, asking in delight, &#8220;They had a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating on Zuck?&#8221; Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 149.16 (+0.34%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 125.10 (+0.61%) S&amp;P 500: Up 29.48 (+0.48%) Market Movers Datadog (Nasdaq: DDOG), which is behind a cloud-based security platform, is advancing 9.1% today after being chosen as the latest addition to the S&amp;P 500, replacing the outgoing Juniper Networks, which is being acquired by Hewlett Packard (NYSE: HPE). With the index inclusion, DDOG will gain exposure to more institutional and retail portfolios including through ETFs. Synopsys (Nasdaq: SNPS) is gaining 4.4% after the U.S. withdrew U.S. &#8220;chip design software curbs on China,&#8221; per reports. Tripadvisor (Nasdaq: TRIP) is soaring 11.5% today on the heels of an investment by activist investor Starboard, which after taking a 9% position in the stock called the shares undervalued.

While Trump described the deadline as &ldquo;firm,&rdquo; he added it was <strong>&ldquo;not 100% firm,&rdquo;</strong> indicating potential for further negotiations or bilateral deals.</p>\r\n<p>In response, <strong>China cautioned</strong> against reigniting trade hostilities and called for a renewed effort to stabilize bilateral relations.</p>\r\n<p>You can track how <strong>these macroeconomic shifts impact U.S. trade balances and inflation metrics</strong> using the <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#economics-calendar-economics-data\"><strong>Economics Calendar API</strong></a>, which provides scheduled updates on CPI, PPI, and international trade data.</p>",

      "content": "Key Points Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has reclaimed its position as the world’s most valuable company, with its stock up over 65% from April lows amid explosive AI infrastructure investment. Demand for AI server chips remains robust as tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ: META), and OpenAI are expected to invest upwards of $600 billion in data center infrastructure. Despite past concerns over China restrictions, Nvidia&#8217;s dominant 92% market share in AI GPUs and upward revenue guidance ($44B for the quarter) continue to sustain bullish momentum.

Again, it&#8217;s I think they&#8217;re up to 3.27 trillion. They passed Microsoft. Interesting. Does that count [00:00:17] Lee Jackson: how much their core weave is up? Yes. [00:00:21] Doug McIntyre: Yes. Now it did something else. And that is, their, Mr. [00:00:25] Doug McIntyre: Huang, their CEO Yes. Is now worth $135 billion. So he was helped out by that as well. Was he ever? Yeah, so I mean, this stock has rallied almost 40%. it hit that, tremendous low in March and it&#8217;s had a ridiculous rally since then. It&#8217;s up like [00:00:49] Lee Jackson: 66%. Yeah, it traded down to almost 90 didn&#8217;t it? [00:00:53] Lee Jackson: Back in April or the, at the very low. [00:00:56] Doug McIntyre: Well, and, at that point, the comment was, is that a big worry about the fact that there was $50 billion that they couldn&#8217;t get because they were being shut out of China by Trump. So I guess their earnings, plus all these announcements about, AI server farms, I think by my calculation, the amount of money in aggregate that&#8217;s going to be invested in AI server farms is about $600 billion. [00:01:27] Doug McIntyre: If you take Microsoft and Meta and OpenAI, what people have said they will spend to build these things. So I think it&#8217;s gonna be [00:01:35] Lee Jackson: more than that. The, place that,or Meta&#8217;s built building in Louisiana is like a whole county. [00:01:43] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. So let&#8217;s just say that&#8217;s the low end. But if you add all those things together. [00:01:49] Doug McIntyre: I think what you get is the impression that they&#8217;re not gonna have any trouble selling, chips at all. No, and listen, there, the one thing about their earnings is that they guided, to 44 billion for this quarter. Right. So that implies that they would be up in revenue another 60 or 70%, quarter over previously years quarter. [00:02:17] Doug McIntyre: and what that means is that their mon momentum stays, from a revenue standpoint, roughly the same. They&#8217;ve got 92% market share. Right now, AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) is second with about, I dunno, six. listen, all companies are stoppable at some point e every, everybody reaches a wall. [00:02:40] Lee Jackson: Yep, they will. They will, [00:02:42] Doug McIntyre: but they haven&#8217;t yet. [00:02:43] Doug McIntyre: So that&#8217;s why. Well, [00:02:45] Lee Jackson: and it, [00:02:46] Lee Jackson: doesn&#8217;t appear, especially based upon, to your point. The addition of all these server farms it&#8217;s everywhere. it&#8217;s all across the country. So yeah, the, I think they have, there&#8217;s some more tailwind to, this rally, but again, we&#8217;re getting near the end of literally a 20% bounce back. [00:03:07] Lee Jackson: So it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how it trades from here. [00:03:10] Doug McIntyre: Well, they&#8217;re also, I think, sort of being helped psychologically by the fact that all the other, with one or two exceptions, all the other big tech stocks have also bounced back. And since so many of them, the impression investors have is that all of these are AI proxies. [00:03:27] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. Yeah. in one way or another, everybody on the list, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), they&#8217;re all, listen Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), that Tesla is now an AI play in the minds of investors, and that&#8217;s why market cap is so much higher than the other car companies. So Nvidia has benefited from two things. It looks like it&#8217;s in great shape and China doesn&#8217;t matter. [00:03:52] Doug McIntyre: And it looks like everybody else is in great shape who wants to be in this business and the people in the private capital is still going into these companies. Yeah, [00:04:05] Lee Jackson: I haven&#8217;t seen a stock like this since the nineties, so I really haven&#8217;t that I can, at least I can think of. I mean, back when everybody would wait for Intel&#8217;s (NASDAQ: INTC) numbers or everybody would wait for Microsoft Numbers or some microsystems or whatever back then, but I haven&#8217;t seen anything like this in a very long time. [00:04:24] Lee Jackson: Yeah. [00:04:26] Doug McIntyre: I&#8217;m gonna say that I think that it still has room to run. I mean, I know that it&#8217;s up by really a ludicrous percentage amount. It&#8217;s at a high, the market cap, 65% off that April low, but I, there&#8217;s no news that&#8217;s gonna stop this until earnings. The China thing is baked. China&#8217;s baked in, right? [00:04:49] Doug McIntyre: Good earnings are baked in. Every time there&#8217;s another, a server farm announcement, nobody&#8217;s surprised. It&#8217;s if you said to me that, OpenAI was gonna open a server farm in Canada and they were gonna spend, a hundred billion dollars, like, okay, sure. that&#8217;s par for the course. [00:05:08] Doug McIntyre: I&#8217;m not surprised at all. So [00:05:10] Lee Jackson: yeah, it&#8217;s really become so, and it&#8217;s interesting though, even though technology has led this big bounce, four of the Mag seven, I think we&#8217;re still down a week ago. I mean, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was down, Tesla was down and, for this year, and I was kind of surprised when I saw that, but boy, it, has been a just a ripped the shorts head off kind of rally that I haven&#8217;t seen in years. [00:05:36] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. So, that takes along with it, the markets are basically at an all time high. Yeah. And so, no surprising, you&#8217;ve got some of these big cap companies, they&#8217;re leading the rally as has happened, the last leg up on this before you had some sell down. It&#8217;s the same companies leading this rally up, so. [00:06:01] Doug McIntyre: Yep, yep. I mean, that&#8217;s the news in this segment. You&#8217;ve got, Wong becoming one of the richest people in the world. You&#8217;ve got the market cap up and you&#8217;ve got all the reasons why it is up, so. [00:06:13] Lee Jackson: yep. And, it&#8217;s the old don&#8217;t want to be the last one in the door versus don&#8217;t wanna not have it in your portfolio if you&#8217;re a pm, Yeah. So it&#8217;s, like you&#8217;re, caught between a rock and a hard place here. [00:06:26] The post Nvidia (NVDA) Doesn&#8217;t Care About China Anymore appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

However, Australian equities underperformed following an unexpected policy hold by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).</p>\r\n<h2>Trump Extends Tariff Deadline, Hints at Flexibility</h2>\r\n<p>Despite issuing letters that outlined higher tariffs for several countries, President Trump announced a shift in the effective date to <strong>August 1</strong>, pushing back from the earlier <strong>July 9</strong> deadline. More importantly, he told reporters the August date was not &ldquo;100% firm&rdquo; and remained open to alternate trade proposals.</p>\r\n<p>These signals of flexibility helped Asian equities rebound after a weak overnight session on Wall Street. U.S. stock futures pared losses, with <strong>S&amp;P 500 Futures</strong> trading flat after initially dipping 0.3%.</p>\r\n<h2>KOSPI, Nikkei Advance Despite Tariff Targeting</h2>\r\n<p>South Korea&rsquo;s <strong>KOSPI surged 1.5%</strong>, led by memory-chip giant <strong>SK Hynix</strong>, which jumped over 3% following weak Q2 profit guidance from rival <strong>Samsung Electronics</strong>. Japan&rsquo;s <strong>Nikkei 225</strong> added 0.3%, while the <strong>TOPIX</strong> index gained 0.1%.</p>\r\n<p>Trump announced <strong>25% tariffs on South Korea, Japan, and Malaysia</strong>, <strong>30% on South Africa</strong>, and <strong>as high as 36% on Thailand</strong>, effective August 1.

      "title": "Recent iPhone Sales Soar",
      "content": "Preliminary findings in tech research firm Counterpoint’s Market Pulse Global Monthly Smartphone Sales Report are that iPhone sales were extremely strong. According to the report, “iPhone sales grew a healthy 15% YoY in April and May, first two months of Q2 2025. This is Apple’s highest market share for these two months combined post pandemic.” 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone sales have been strong in recent months. Expected price increases due to tariffs are one reason for the increased demand. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has posted sales declines in this period for three years. The reversal of the trend was largely due to the United States and China. “Both US and China returned to positive YoY growth after three years of declines in this less seasonal period,” the authors wrote. There are probably two reasons for the jump. One is that U.S. consumers want to buy an iPhone before tariffs as high as 25% raise prices. The other is that Apple has offered “attractive” prices in China. Counterpoint also noted that iPhone sales in Japan had risen. Demand for the new iPhone 16e, a compact version of the product, triggered the increase. Sales in India have also risen. That market has changed, according to the report: “The iPhone is the most aspirational tech product for tech-savvy consumers here.” The news is particularly good because Samsung, Apple’s greatest global smartphone competition, has introduced new foldable phones. Moreover, Apple has had some success in China, where local companies such as Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo have strong footholds. Apple’s iPhone sales remain constrained because it has not launched the advanced artificial intelligence (AI) product it said would be part of its new iOS. The company says this will not be released until next year. This has disappointed some consumers and affected demand. While consumers worldwide cannot evaluate Apple’s new AI today, it has not undermined sales as much as some experts who follow the company thought it would. Why Is No One Talking About Apple’s Long-Term Artificial Intelligence Plans? The post Recent iPhone Sales Soar appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

      "title": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Predicts AI’s ‘Make or Break’ Moment is Almost Here",
      "content": "Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) researchers recently released a paper named &#8216;Illusions of Thinking&#8216; that casts new doubts on the capabilities of &#8216;reasoning&#8217; models that are seeing tens of billions of dollars of research and development in the AI space. In the segment below, 24/7 Wall St. Analyst Eric Bleeker breaks down the implications of Apple&#8217;s newest paper. Bleeker says that investors will want to key in on whether AI can make &#8216;novel discoveries&#8217; in 2026. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has predicted that leading AI models will begin making these discoveries in 2026. If that happens, AI spending will continue to race full speed ahead. If 2026 passes without novel discoveries, then Apple&#8217;s criticisms of reasoning models will look more compelling. Key Points Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is taking a contrarian stance in the AI space, downplaying reasoning model capabilities in a recent research paper and showing reduced AI emphasis at WWDC, contrasting sharply with peers&#8217; aggressive AI investments. While OpenAI, backed by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), is pushing toward novel AI discoveries by 2026 with infrastructure like Stargate, Apple appears culturally and strategically hesitant to embrace foundational AI advancements. Despite skepticism from Apple’s research, usage data and capabilities like DeepMind&#8217;s AlphaFold show current AI can already dramatically accelerate scientific discovery, offering substantial near-term economic value.

Instead its relying on partnerships with companies like OpenAI. At 24/7 Wall St., we believe the release of reasoning models &#8211; roughly corresponding to the release of o3 in December last year … Is the next step-change in AI model capabilities. However, a recent paper from Apple researchers casts doubt on the overall capabilities of reasoning models. The paper &#8211; named &#8216;Illusions of Thinking&#8217; &#8211; detailed how reasoning models solve a series of puzzles. The paper&#8217;s findings were essentially that reasoning models capabilities are more limited than believed &#8211; they&#8217;re just advanced pattern matching. Our take: we don’t find the paper especially compelling. We won’t get into too many details, but AI researchers we follow have poked some pretty sizable holes into how the study was conducted and its overall conclusions. Here&#8217;s what we think is important to watch if you&#8217;re concerend about Apple&#8217;s recent paper. One of the biggest criticisms of AI has been: Where are the novel discoveries? That is to say, while AI has contributed to some major discoveries like protein-folding, there have been no major discoveries directly made by leading AI models. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, recently published a blog that’s worth reading. It&#8217;s named &#8216;The Gentle Singularity.&#8217; In it, he lays out a timeline we can come back to and hold him accountable to. 2025: Rise of Agents 2026: Novel insights from AI 2027: Robots that can do tasks in the real world So, essentially he’s dropping the gauntlet that GPT5 will be powerful enough for these novel discoveries… If that’s the case, the upside for AI essentially becomes infinite; it is the driver for economic progress for the remainder of our lives. If it’s wrong… Total spend on AI is likely too high at current rates. The AI Investor Podcast Is Your Source What Could Become Technology&#8217;s Biggest Trend Ever This discussion comes from 24/7 Wall St.&#8217;s AI Investor Podcast. The podcast covers the biggest developments in AI and how you can build a portfolio filled with the highest-upside stocks in the space. You can listen to our most recent episode on YouTube or leading podcast apps like Apple Podcasts or Spotify. Transcript: [00:00:05] Austin Smith: And now, you know, a, a counterpoint to that is I wanna talk about this Apple Illusions of thinking paper, because Apple is one of the largest tech companies that, you know what I mean? Like, like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Microsoft was really hot on AI. But in their most recent, uh, worldwide developer conference, there was way less AI, way less Apple intelligence than in the prior release. [00:00:24] Austin Smith: So on one hand, we&#8217;re seeing Apple sort of standalone here, and some of the, the steam is coming out of their own AI enthusiasm and they&#8217;re releasing this illusions of thinking paper that sort of puts a little bit of cold water on the AI narrative. So, but, but everything else we&#8217;re seeing is an increase in demand and compute and inference from everybody else in Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and Microsoft and Google. [00:00:45] Austin Smith: So. What is going on with Apple? Are they, you know, is this a cultural change? Is this, is this something? Are they seeing something other people don&#8217;t? Why does Apple sort of stand alone here in this super major AI space? [00:00:58] Eric Bleeker: Yeah. Apple&#8217;s such an interesting company, right? Because everyone else is spending tens of billions of dollars on CapEx and they&#8217;ve kind of not played that game. [00:01:07] Eric Bleeker: They can do that in part because they have unique distribution right at the start of smartphones. You have said their greatest weakness is. Something like search all these Google services, they, they don&#8217;t control that and they&#8217;re beholding, but the end outcome was they end up charging Google 20 or $30 billion per year in pure profits to become the default search engine. [00:01:29] Eric Bleeker: So them being that initial point of distribution as the operating system for all consumer devices allows them to play a little bit of a different game. But it&#8217;s also kind of in their best interests. To kind of talk down some of the areas that they&#8217;re not competing in, which is a bit what this paper did. [00:01:50] Eric Bleeker: It comes from, um, apple researchers and basically we&#8217;ve talked about along this show, our belief is that in December of last year, the birth of new powerful reasoning models, which really began when oh three was released on December 20th, was the next step change in AI demand. And what Apple&#8217;s researchers came out and said is that they believe that these reasoning models that are coming out through a series of puzzles that they tried having them solve, that they put in the paper, basically had just a lot less capability than people believed. [00:02:28] Eric Bleeker: Essentially. They&#8217;re just much better at pattern matching, uh, than people give them credit for. So this Austin, this got a lot of attention, right? Because it&#8217;s potentially saying it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s another. A potential piece of evidence that we&#8217;re in a bubble, that AI is just going to hit a wall, where when you ask it to take that next step, the next step being discovering novel discoveries. [00:02:55] Eric Bleeker: Mm-hmm. You know, asking AI to start doing things like finding cures for diseases. It&#8217;s not going to be able to make that jump. And if that is the case, that would be tremendously bad for that future of outlook and all the spending that&#8217;s happening right now. Right. So my take on this, and again, I am not an AI researcher. [00:03:16] Eric Bleeker: My main job is to basically find who I believe are the smartest minds and, and people that have great track records on this. I. And evaluate who I think is the most accurate. And, and I don&#8217;t find the paper especially compelling. I, I won&#8217;t get into too many details, but a lot of people have poked some pretty sizable holes into how this study was conducted. [00:03:39] Eric Bleeker: But I, I do wanna point out Austin, you know, of the other big storylines that&#8217;s, you know, maybe on the fringes that if, if you&#8217;re investing in ai you don&#8217;t see, was Sam Altman, who&#8217;s the CEO of Open AI. He released a blog this year, uh, or. This week, I should say, um, just about his thoughts on AI. It, it&#8217;s named the gentle Singularity. [00:04:01] Eric Bleeker: You could search that, you could search his blog and you could find it, but in layman&#8217;s terms, he&#8217;s, he&#8217;s making a lot of predictions you can hold him accountable to and in his belief. 2025. The story is the rise of agents. That&#8217;s something we agree with. We&#8217;ve been saying since last year, you know, mid last year, we&#8217;ve always said we believe the narrative this year, especially in the back half, would be the rise of agents. [00:04:27] Eric Bleeker: He believes 2026 is going to be the birth of novel insights from AI, and 2027 is robotics that can change the real world. So you know this, this lines up Austin, right? With a lot of storylines we&#8217;re talking about. But he is essentially dropping the gauntlet that, as I mentioned earlier, OpenAI is waiting for Stargate to become operational, uh, to basically train their next version, uh, GPT five, to have the capability to do that. [00:04:59] Eric Bleeker: And once that&#8217;s happened, he believes those novel discoveries will start becoming a storyline next year. So that becomes one of the things that we will be actively tracking on this podcast that. If you start seeing novel discoveries from AI, we are on pace. And frankly, if AI starts making meaningful novel discoveries, that is the strongest validation yet that it becomes the main economic driver for the rest of our lives. [00:05:30] Eric Bleeker: Mm-hmm. And if that is the case and, and you&#8217;re not actively investing in this, good luck to you because that, that will be a little bit of a rubber meets the road moment. We&#8217;re gonna be watching out for. [00:05:42] Austin Smith: Right. And you know, to, to anybody who&#8217;s listening to that and saying, oh, well maybe I&#8217;ll wait until AI has proven in the, the novel discovery framework before I become an investor. [00:05:51] Austin Smith: I think that would be a mistake as well, because that&#8217;s not to say that the current versions of AI and LLMs don&#8217;t have incredible economic forces and tailwinds behind them. You talked about medicine discovery, uh, famously alpha fold, you know, detected protein foldings and predicted 3D structures of proteins, which is a very complicated, uh, thing to do. [00:06:10] Austin Smith: And it didn&#8217;t necessarily uncover new breakthroughs per se, but it completely supercharged the discovery of these, uh, folding structures that would&#8217;ve been discovered just over a much longer timeframe. So it pulled forward all of those discoveries faster. Now, that might not necessarily have been novel. [00:06:26] Austin Smith: It was applying techniques that, as I understand it, certainly not an AI researcher, but was applying techniques that. We already had and knew, but just completely supercharged them and allowed us to make discoveries earlier. You know, when I read the, the, or tried to read, I should say, the illusions of Thinking paper by Apple, it, it sounded a little bit to me like a case. [00:06:45] Austin Smith: Maybe it&#8217;s just a case of someone coming from sour grapes a little bit like I. You know, Apple&#8217;s always been a bit of a taste maker company and designing the thing you, you didn&#8217;t know you needed and then you can&#8217;t live without. And they&#8217;ve been uniquely good at that, perhaps the best of all time. Um, but technologically speaking, a reasoning model just gives up a lot of that to, to the model. [00:07:02] Austin Smith: And it might be just culturally antithetical to, to what Apple is built on as a company. So, you know, I&#8217;m, I you gotta pay attention to everything that happens in this space. Apple&#8217;s incredibly gifted at what they do. Um, but this, this didn&#8217;t change my thinking about the potential of, of what we&#8217;re seeing. [00:07:17] Eric Bleeker: And I do wanna double click on one point you made there that you know, you can always say, I will just wait for this. Next, threat or overhang to resolve before I invest. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to go through the cycles that as new trends happen that you&#8217;re able to see in real time. [00:07:35] Eric Bleeker: There is always something new that says, there&#8217;s a reason I shouldn&#8217;t invest in this today. So if you&#8217;re waiting for one threat to go. There will be another. Nothing is an absolute slam dunk. Last week, Austin, we talked about the best time on a risk adjusted basis to buy Apple was six years after mobile started. [00:07:52] Eric Bleeker: Mm-hmm. Um, the trough of disillusionment for the internet itself came eight years after it started. There&#8217;s always going to be some new threat that, you know, unless you followed one of these cycles, to truly appreciate that you&#8217;re never going to make money investing in a perfectly rosy picture. It&#8217;s just really hard to understand that that&#8217;s part of why we wanted to start this podcast was to give that record of investing throughout the a i Age. [00:08:22] Eric Bleeker: &#8217;cause at some point in retrospect, it&#8217;ll be, I believe it&#8217;ll be of course. Why didn&#8217;t you invest in that AI was obvious, right? And it&#8217;s not obvious. And we&#8217;ve broken down all the areas where we had to be incredibly. Counter to the dominant narratives, you know, you&#8217;ll be able to go back around When we did our deep seek episodes, where we called it before it happened, where we broke it down after, and we have been knocking down a lot of these, you know, bear cases. [00:08:53] Eric Bleeker: It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not because we are blind cheerleaders for AI. Far from it, you know, we are people who want to make money and the only thing that makes you money in the long run is what happens in reality. But you know, again, we, we have believed that this story&#8217;s happening and, and we have gone through many of these threats in the front half of the year to have a show today that is. [00:09:19] Eric Bleeker: Largely just focused on acceleration and bullishness, which couldn&#8217;t be any different from what we were seeing five, six months ago.​ The post OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Predicts AI&#8217;s &#8216;Make or Break&#8217; Moment is Almost Here appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",
