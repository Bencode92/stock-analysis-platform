      "title": "5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens on Wednesday",
      "content": "Close U.S. stock futures are pointing lower as investors ready for today's tariffs announcement expected from President Donald Trump after markets close; Tesla (TSLA) is slated to report first-quarter deliveries amid a downturn for its stock; Visa (V) reportedly is offering a payment of roughly $100 million to get Apple's (AAPL) credit card payment network business; and USDC stablecoin issuer Circle files for an IPO. Here's what investors need to know today. 1. US Stock Futures Dip as Investors Await Tariffs Updates U.S. stock futures are pointing lower following a volatile trading session as investors await White House tariff plans expected to be announced later today. Market watchers are also following today's private sector payrolls release ahead of Friday's job report. Nasdaq futures are 0.8% lower after the tech-focused index gained 0.9% Tuesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 futures are lower by about 0.5%. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is down slightly at around $85,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is down below 4.15%. Oil futures are down. Gold futures are slightly higher. 2. Investors Brace for Trump Tariffs Announcement After Markets Close President Donald Trump is set to unveil his latest tariffs proposal at a White House event slated to start at the close of markets at 4 p.m. ET. Trump's advisers continue to hash out the details surrounding the new tariffs he plans to implement ahead of the \"Liberation Day\" event, Bloomberg reported. While Trump has said he was seeking reciprocal tariffs to match import taxes on U.S.-made products, a report in The Washington Post indicated that advisers were also mulling a 20% tariff on nearly all imported products. 3. Tesla Stock Slips Ahead of Quarterly Deliveries Data Tesla (TSLA) shares are down 2.5% in premarket trading ahead of the electric vehicle maker's expected release of its first-quarter deliveries data this morning. Analysts expect Tesla to report 393,000 deliveries, up less than 2% year-over-year but fewer than last quarter's 495,570 vehicles. The data comes as analysts have raised concerns that CEO Elon Musk's work with the Trump administration is creating distractions and impacting Tesla's business. Tesla shares have shed one-third of their value in 2025. 4. Visa Offers Apple $100M to Take Over Credit Card Network, Report Says Visa (V) is offering a payment of roughly $100 million to get Apple's (AAPL) credit card network business, according to The Wall Street Journal. The report said that Apple would select a payment provider before selecting a bank to take over its credit card from Goldman Sachs (GS), and that Visa is competing with Mastercard (MA)—which is \"fiercely trying to keep its role as the network on this card\"—and American Express (AXP). The Journal previously reported that JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Synchrony Financial (SYF), Capital One (COF) and American Express were in the running to take over as the issuer of the credit card. 5. USDC Stablecoin Issuer Circle Files for IPO Circle, the company behind the dollar-backed USDC stablecoin, has filed for a U.S. initial public offering (IPO). In its prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Circle said it plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under ticker symbol \"CRCL.\" Circle, which had previously announced plans to go public in 2021 via a SPAC merger, said its 2024 net income was $155.7 million, down from $267.6 million a year earlier.

      "title": "Bernard Arnault’s Brilliant Advice for Anyone Dreaming of Retirement One Day",
      "content": "If one visits almost any medium to large sized mall around the globe, certain luxury brand name stores or products tend to dominate, such as: Louis Vuitton Kenzo Fendi Sephora Tiffany Christian Dior Givenchy Dom Perignom Bulgari Guerlain ….and numerous others. All of these luxury brands and about 65 others all have a few things in common: they are high demand, top-dollar price tagged, and are all owned by LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton SE (OTC: LVMUY), the Paris, France headquartered luxury conglomerate helmed by Bernard Arnault. Arnault’s savvy management and focus on high-end, top of the line products has catapulted him into multibillionaire status, with a net worth that fluctuates between rivalling and even exceeding that of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, based on the stock price of LVMH at any given time. Despite the vast differences in the types of companies they find attractive and demographics of their respective customer bases for those companies, Arnault and Buffett share a “buy and hold” long term investment strategy mindset, and investors can find useful applications for several of the underlying rationales for how Arnault invests, even without the billions at his disposal. Key Points Both Warren Buffett’s and Bernard Arnault’s investing successes are based on a “buy and hold” strategy, although Berkshire Hathaway and LVMH could not be more unlike as corporate entities. In terms of stock price appreciation, Berkshire Hathaway has appreciated 2,800% over 30 years (1993-2023), while in the same time period, LVMH grew 100,000%. Although Arnault acquires a controlling interest in most of his companies like Buffett, there are underlying principles and rationales for his selections, which individual investors can also learn from and utilize. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Optimistic In The Long Term; Pessimistic In The Short Term Tiffany&#8217;s renowned reputation for premium jewelry and artistic craftmanship made it a must-have brand for LVMH to acquire. Whereas Warren Buffett characteristically pursues conservative companies with solid earnings that are undervalued, Arnault is much more aggressive, preferring high growth potential companies with high quality products that have underachieved through poor management or marketing. By investing in new designs and marketing, Arnault believes true value will eventually be achieved. Additionally, whereas Buffett’s modus operandi is to buy companies at bargain levels as low as possible to offset risk, Arnault has no qualms about paying a premium to acquire control over highly desired brands that he can then escalate even further. Buffett’s approach concentrates much more on intrinsic value and earnings and eschews hype or popularity, and is focused on solidly established industries, such as consumer goods, insurance, railroads, food, and banking. This explains Berkshire Hathaway’s late involvement in investing in technology. Conversely, Arnault’s focus on the luxury goods sector has helped LVMH to nearly corner the market on certain top brand couture, perfumes, champagnes, and accessories. That said, Arnault values diversification with synergy, as he has also branched out into related sectors like media and technology, especially if they can contribute to increasing value for his other holdings. While Arnault’s approach is unequivocally higher risk, the returns have been stellar. In a 30 year stretch from 1993 to 2023, Berkshire Hathaway stock grew 2,800%. In that same period, although much more volatile. LVMH grew 100,000%. Investing Tips for Retirees Berard Arnault&#8217;s acquisition selection principles can easily be applied to stock choices for one&#8217;s retirement portfolio. Bernard Arnault’s acquisition strategies are multimillion-dollar or even billion-dollar affairs. However, the underlying rationale for most of his acquisition choices are predicated on principles that will work to build any portfolio, and is something that retirees may especially wish to consider incorporating for their own stock picks: Quality Over Quantity &#8211; Some investors, especially Baby Boomers, are intimidated by the high prices of certain stocks, especially when they reach triple digits. However, if the investment is part of a growth portfolio, even 5 or 10 shares of a Magnificent 7 stock, such as Apple or Microsoft, will likely fare better than 100 shares of a company with more marginal upside potential. Look For Innovation &#8211; Companies that are not trying to innovate or who go on autopilot instead of investing in R&amp;D, will likely become stagnant over the long haul. The ones who are pushing the envelope will have a stronger chance for a big breakthrough, Think Globally &#8211; Arnault’s luxury brands have universal appeal in practically all contemporary societies, throughout all of the developed nations and emerging nations, to even Communist societies, where LVMH goods like Louis Vuitton handbags fetch enormous sums on the black market. Companies that market to the world as opposed to only a limited local market have a greater chance for long-term massive growth. On the topic of retirement, Arnault clearly loves what he does. He has led LVMH for 35 years and had the company’s by-laws for retirement extended twice, first to 80, and then to 85, when he himself reached age 76. His other advice to potential retirees would likely be to avoid it if you love what you’re doing.

      "title": "France fines Apple €150 million over app tracking violations, EU probes follow",
      "content": "Apple has been hit with a €150 million ($162 million) fine by France’s competition authority over its App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, a move that adds pressure from multiple fronts as investigations in other EU countries gain traction. The penalty, announced on Monday, stems from how the iPhone maker rolled out the ATT feature, which critics argue undermines competition by limiting third-party advertising while boosting Apple’s own ad services.The fine reflects growing concern in the European Union about how dominant tech companies enforce privacy standards that may also act as commercial barriers. In Apple’s case, regulators found that ATT, introduced in 2021, unfairly impacted rival app developers and publishers by making user consent harder for third parties to obtain.ATT rollout triggers EU probesFrench regulators said Apple’s ATT rollout was neither necessary nor proportionate to the company’s stated goal of protecting user privacy. Although the tool asks users whether they want apps to track their activity across other apps and websites, the French Competition Authority found that the system was designed in a way that placed a heavier burden on third-party developers than on Apple itself.One major issue was the number of consent pop-ups users encountered. While third-party apps were required to display the ATT prompt, Apple’s own advertising services were integrated in a way that required less user effort to accept. Users had to opt out of ad tracking twice in Apple’s own settings, which the French watchdog said undermined the feature’s neutrality.Apple has also been ordered to publish the decision on its website for seven days, a standard measure in France for competition-related rulings.The French investigation originated from industry complaints filed in 2021. While emergency action was denied at the time, the regulator pursued a full-scale probe that has now led to financial penalties.Smaller publishers lose ad revenueIn its ruling, France’s authority emphasised the disproportionate economic impact ATT had on smaller app developers and ad service providers. These smaller players typically rely on third-party data collection for revenue generation through targeted advertising. Apple’s changes disrupted these practices, cutting off access to Apple&#8217;s Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) if users declined consent via the ATT prompt.This restriction effectively altered the dynamics of the mobile advertising market, where Apple&#8217;s rivals found themselves operating under stricter conditions. Apple, on the other hand, retained certain capabilities for its own ads within the App Store and other services.The competition body argued that ATT&#8217;s dual opt-out process placed unnecessary hurdles in front of users and made it more likely that they would remain in Apple&#8217;s ecosystem, giving the company an edge in the mobile ad space.Investigations spread to 4 countriesThe fine is part of broader scrutiny in Europe. Competition authorities in Germany, Italy, Romania, and Poland have each launched similar investigations into ATT, reflecting concerns that Apple may be favouring its own services in ways that violate local and EU-wide competition laws.These investigations focus not only on ATT’s technical implementation but also on the market power Apple holds through its control of iOS, the App Store, and user access to device-level data.While the French authority acted independently, any eventual findings from these additional countries could fuel coordinated EU action or raise the possibility of further fines and regulatory measures.Apple’s privacy tool under fireApple introduced ATT in April 2021 as part of iOS 14.5, presenting it as a privacy-focused feature aimed at giving users control over how apps track their online behaviour. The move was widely welcomed by privacy advocates, but triggered immediate backlash from advertisers and app developers.Since the rollout, Apple’s ad business has grown significantly, driven in part by increased reliance on the App Store’s native ad network. Critics argue that Apple’s design choices favour its own ecosystem while making it harder for competitors to maintain viable advertising models.Although the ATT framework technically applies to all apps, the French Competition Authority said Apple was not held to the same standard as others when it came to gaining user consent, thus violating the principle of fair access and harming competition.The post France fines Apple €150 million over app tracking violations, EU probes follow appeared first on Invezz",

      "title": "I’ve hit every financial milestone, yet I feel empty – am I sacrificing real happiness for more digits?",
      "content": "For some people who&#8217;ve grown addicted to pursuing wealth and the euphoric feeling that often comes with the chase, it can be really tough to find a similar degree of satisfaction with other things in life. Indeed, obsessing over wealth, investments, net worth, and work can have a pretty amazing side effect: a fatter retirement fund and enough financial freedom to do as one&#8217;s heart desires. That said, it&#8217;s important to remember that money is a tool and not the end goal itself. When it comes to things like the net worth of one&#8217;s nest egg, it&#8217;s all too easy to raise the bar and move the goal posts. For many financial overachievers, the &#8220;money doesn&#8217;t buy happiness&#8221; phrase applies. And while these words are easy to dismiss if you haven&#8217;t yet hit your own financial milestones (it&#8217;s proven that money can buy happiness for those who are under financial stress and anxiety), I do think that after accumulating a certain figure in the bank that the phrase begins to ring true, perhaps like never before. Key Points It&#8217;s not healthy to tie one&#8217;s self-worth to one&#8217;s net worth. To quote the great Steve Wozniak, happiness is more a matter of &#8220;smiles minus frowns.&#8221; Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Feeling &#8220;empty&#8221; with $14 million banked? But how? In this piece, we&#8217;ll look at a specific case involving a Reddit user who &#8220;feels empty&#8221; after hitting every major financial milestone. They&#8217;re wondering how they can achieve &#8220;real&#8221; happiness that doesn&#8217;t involve raising the bar again, only to feel the same sense of emptiness later on. Indeed, tying one&#8217;s worth and happiness to money can be a dangerous game, especially as the winds of recession (or Trump recession) roll in and one&#8217;s nest egg stands to take a hit, either due to rising unemployment, re-heated inflation, or a continuously tanking stock market. In the face of such sudden financial setbacks, one may lose more than just a few figures in the bank account; they may also lose a sense of identity and self-worth. Add endless comparisons with colleagues, bosses, or those on social media into the equation, and it&#8217;s easy to feel like one doesn&#8217;t have enough. Sure, a $14 million net worth is profoundly impressive. But if your colleague brags about having far more than that, it can be easy to feel like you need to keep raising the bar in perpetuity, as one misses out on the invaluable experiences that bring about genuine happiness. At the end of the day, there&#8217;s always a bigger fish. And it&#8217;s better not to play the game of comparisons if one seeks fulfillment rather than emptiness. It&#8217;s time to view money as a tool, not as a measure of one&#8217;s worth. It&#8217;s a wise idea to view money as a means to an end rather than the end goal itself. Money comes in, money goes out. But either way, the Reddit user should seek to rediscover things they value more than money and focus on these areas now that they have achieved — and surpassed — all their financial objectives. As such, it&#8217;s important to know when to draw a line in the sand so one can pursue real happiness rather than the dopamine hit to be had from adding a few more dollars to the pile. For a father of four children who has more than enough a family could ever need ($14 million in net worth), our Reddit user doesn&#8217;t need to look too far to find joy and fulfillment. In most pieces responding to Reddit posts, I encourage contacting a financial advisor or wealth planner. But in this piece, I think some counselling is a must, as the individual looks to sever their sense of meaning and value from how much money is coming in. Despite their exceptional financial accomplishments, they do not have a healthy relationship with money. For such an individual, the happiness equation is less about cash inflows minus cash outflows, and perhaps more about &#8220;smiles minus frowns&#8221; — a far better equation that Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak uses to measure his happiness. The bottom line For anyone who can relate to our Reddit user, perhaps it&#8217;s time to keep tabs on all the things that make you smile. Oftentimes, more money can mean more frowns. As such, it&#8217;s essential to diversify your sources of smiles so that you can avoid the type of rude awakening our Reddit user is experiencing now. They&#8217;re experiencing emptiness when they should be reaching peak joy.

      "content": "Due to efforts to bolster U.S. domestic chip production and reduce reliance on overseas supply chains, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM), AKA TSMC, plans to drastically increase its investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, including new fabrication plants and advanced packaging facilities in Arizona. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) holds a crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain, commanding over 60% of global spending at chip foundries. Its ability to deliver cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities is essential for customers developing artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing, and other advanced technologies. Therefore, we see a more than 46% gain for the stock by the end of the decade. If you’re looking for some stocks with huge potential, make sure to grab a free copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. It features a software stock we’re confident has 10X potential. The stock hit an all-time high of $226.40 earlier this year but has been in retreat since then. In fact, the share price is 8.3% lower than at the start of the year. It is up 28.9% year over year, though, outperforming the broader markets in that time. Wall Street remains optimistic, and analysts see plenty of room for the stock to run, at least in the short term. Investors are of course concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. Although most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it is clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term prognostications irrelevant. 24/7 Wall St. aims to present some farther-looking insights based on TSMC’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help with your own research. All Roads Lead to Taiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor has control of roughly 62% of the global chip market. In the high-tech universe, there is a single common road that top-flight companies like Nvidia, AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and many others must travel to get their chips made, no matter where they hail from. That road inevitably leads to TSMC, the largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. When a company like Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) designs a new chip, it takes it to TSMC to actually print the design on a silicon wafer. TSMC is the top choice for Nvidia, AMD, and many other chip designers, thanks to its precision, quality control, and innovative technical capabilities. At the time of this writing, TSMC commands over 60% of global spending at chip foundries. The explosion of growth in the artificial intelligence and data center arenas have led to a commensurate demand acceleration for graphics processing unit (GPU) chips and a panoply of similar ones for those fields. By focusing on precision foundry work, TSMC has become the premier “go-to” player, for chip designers, even among those competing in various sectors. TSMC does face certain challenges, including: Despite its crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain, Taiwan Semiconductor is based in Taiwan. The Leadership of the People’s Republic of China claims that Taiwan is a part of China proper. Any overt military action on Taiwanese soil likely would result in a domino-effect of chip shortages. TSMC had raised prices for its 3-nanometer and 5-nm process products by up to 8%. However, Samsung is focusing on its 2-nm process to meet future technologies’ high-performance, low-power, and high-bandwidth requirements, and rival Intel has a 1.4-nm ultra-fine process slated to be unveiled in 2027. The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical. While AI investment soars, TSMC has few rivals of significance. During slow periods, semiconductor companies have often been glutted with excess inventory. It remains to be seen how TSMC will handle a slowdown after ramping up production to such a high level. TSMC&#8217;s Performance The company experienced significant growth and transformation from 2014 to 2024, in that time solidifying its position as a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing. 2014 was the year that the TSMC-Apple cooperation began in earnest, with Apple’s A8 and A8X SoCss. Such has the cooperation expanded that Apple has gone to TSMC for nearly 100% of its chip requirements by 2024. Opposing patent infringement lawsuits with GlobalFoundries in 2019 eventually settled with a cross-licensing agreement, which ends in 2029. 2020 saw TSMC prudently decide to diversify its manufacturing by opening up new plants in Phoenix, Arizona, and Dresden, Germany. In July 2020, TSMC signed a 20-year deal with Ørsted to buy the entire production of two offshore wind farms under development off Taiwan&#8217;s west coast. At the time of its signing, it was the world&#8217;s largest corporate green energy order ever made. 2021 saw TSMC form joint ventures with Sony and Denso in Japan.

The surge in artificial intelligence (AI) is a primary driver for TSMC, but its future growth is also heavily tied to strategic partnerships, geopolitical considerations, and the following: Technological Leadership: TSMC&#8217;s ongoing advancement in process technology, particularly in nodes like 3nm and beyond, allows them to command premium pricing and maintain a strong market share. The company&#8217;s ability to deliver cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities is essential for customers developing advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing, and advanced mobile devices. Demand from Key Sectors: The increasing demand for semiconductors in crucial fields like AI, high-performance computing (HPC), and 5G and advanced mobile devices. While the surge in AI applications drives a need for the powerful chips TSMC manufactures, data centers and other HPC applications also require high-end semiconductors. Furthermore, the evolution of 5G and the increasing sophistication of mobile devices contribute significantly to TSMC&#8217;s revenue. Supply Chain Dynamics: The importance of robust semiconductor supply chains is undeniable, and TSMC&#8217;s role in that chain is very crucial. This serves as an incentive for the international community to keep Taiwan out of Beijing’s control. Because of its uniquely advanced manufacturing capabilities, TSMC can easily scale for demand acceleration, and it holds close to a near monopoly on large graphics processing unit (GPU) chip contracts from major semiconductor designers for AI and data center use. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 TSMC’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips that can mimic many human brain functions. The consensus recommendation for TSMC stock from 17 Wall Street analysts is to buy shares. Three of those analysts have Strong Buy ratings. Their average price target in 12 months is $247.07, which is 37.5% above the current price. 24/7 Wall St.’s 12-month projection for TSMC’s price is $183.92 a share, which signals a gain of 2.4% in the coming year. While the company is set to start its 2-nm process this year, Samsung has a vested interest in developing its own niche advantage and support from the Korean government in that space. As a result, we do not anticipate as big of a 2025 surge from 2-nm as other analysts might. Outlook for the Next 5 Years Since TSMC consumes as much as 5% of Taiwan’s entire energy output, its Ørsted wind farm energy production should manifest tangible cost savings benefits. Therefore, we project 2026’s stock price to hit $186.00, a 5.8% year-over-year retreat. While its 2-nm process will likely compete favorably at the start against Samsung, the TSMC competitive advantage in other avenues of chip manufacturing will ultimately prove to be overwhelming. The anticipated surge of data center spending on chips should fuel larger contracts. Collaborations with research institutions and tech giants in developing next-generation AI chips could open new revenue streams and strengthen its position as an innovation leader in the industry. Our projection for 2027 is $206.80. 2028 should begin to see the rewards from the 2024 R&amp;D surge of $32 billion in advanced process technologies. New products from TSM investments in quantum computing research are expected to bear fruit by 2028, potentially revolutionizing certain computing applications. The company’s focus on developing ultra-low power consumption chips for IoT and edge computing devices could position it as a key player in the growing market for energy-efficient technologies. The 2028 24/7 Wall St. price target is $213.90. 2029 will mark the expiration of TSMC’s GlobalFoundries cross-licensing agreement, which should double up the revenues from that stream. Further developments in chips for quantum computing, healthcare, and other applications can open up more direct government contract opportunities. U.S. and German TSMC factories should be operating at full capacity by 2029. We anticipate a price jump to $245.99. By 2030, TSMC&#8217;s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips at the forefront of AI applications. These would mimic human brain functions more closely than ever before. The company’s involvement in space exploration projects and renewable energy initiatives may also diversify its revenue streams and enhance its global technological influence. We expect a $254.59 stock price, representing a more than 46% gain over today&#8217;s stock price.

UnitedHealth Group stock has been a weight on the Dow and S&amp;P 500 today after its worrying quarterly results and outlook. Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON), which is part of the Nasdaq Composite, is gaining over 2% on the day. The company reports its quarterly results on April 29. The company is in the midst of spinning off a couple of business divisions, and the stock is nearing the $200 per share level. Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) is down 1% after BMO Capital cut its price target on the stock to $200 per share, which still represents upside from current levels of $151 per share. Texas Instruments (Nasdaq: TXN) is gaining 1.5% on the day as the company expands its chip footprint in the auto sector. Market Gains Slip 8:17 am The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are struggling to keep their grip on gains after coming out of the gate higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains pressured with a 1.2% loss on the day. UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) stock is a major drag on the Dow, owing to disappointing quarterly results, while CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) remains a bright spot, rising 1.2% on the day. Chip stock Qualcomm (Nasdaq: QCOM) is up nearly 1% this morning on a bullish report out of Citi analysts. Sector performance is largely positive, led by a 2.4% gain in energy stocks but dampened by a tech sector that has just turned south. After yesterday&#8217;s massive technology sell-off, the markets are licking their wounds, with the three major stock market averages giving a mixed showing. Among the gainers is the Nasdaq Composite with a 0.63% advance and the S&amp;P 500 also fractionally higher while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently erasing over 400 points. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green today, a complete reversal from yesterday&#8217;s leader board. The markets are still processing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell&#8217;s comments from yesterday, which were on the hawkish side of monetary policy. Earnings are capturing some attention away from tariffs with railway CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) gaining 1% on the heels of its Q1 print. CSX faced challenges in the quarter, including a 7% year-over-year decline in revenue, but met consensus expectations amid a backdrop of weaker coal prices and dwindling fuel surcharges. Big Tech is mostly showing green this morning but remains mired in losses over the past five-day stretch, including a 2% drop in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), 14% decline in Meta (Nasdaq: META) and nearly 9% drop in Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) over the past week or so. UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) is a big drag on the Dow, shaving off 18% of its value today alone on disappointing earnings results. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 446 (-1.09%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 118.75 (+0.65%) S&amp;P 500: Up 22 (+0.41%) Market Movers Qualcomm (Nasdaq; QCOM) is rising today on the heels of a bullish report out of Citi analysts, who reportedly raised estimates on the company and added it to their positive catalyst watchlist thanks to robust demand for its chipsets out of China. QCOM stock has been volatile and is down 11% year-to-date. Citi also likes Generac Holdings (Nasdaq: GNRC), upgrading the stock to &#8220;buy&#8221; with a &#8220;high-risk&#8221; tone from &#8220;neutral.&#8221; BMO has upgraded shares of wood producer (NYSE: TREX) Trex to &#8220;outperform&#8221; from &#8220;market perform,&#8221; calling shares attractive. The stock is up 1.8% today. The post Live Nasdaq Composite: CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) Rises Amid Pivot to Earnings appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

      "title": "Live Nasdaq Composite: Gold Up, APLD (Nasdaq: APLD) Rises 5% in Bright Spot",
      "content": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Nasdaq Composite Spirals 4% Lower 3:11 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets have widened their losses after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell addressed tariffs and their impact on the economy. Chairman Powell warned that tariffs could throw a wrench into the central bank&#8217;s efforts to tame inflation and spur economic growth. The Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach to monetary policy in the meantime. The Nasdaq Composite is spiraling 4% lower, weighed down by a 9% drop in Nvidia (Nasdaq; NVDA) and other Big Tech names on the tariff fallout. All sectors of the economy are lower with the exception of energy, which is up 1% as a group. Here&#8217;s a look at where things stand as of late afternoon trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 847.60 (-2.10%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 713.07 (-4.24%) S&amp;P 500: Down 161.77 (-3%) Gainers in a Sea of Red 12:32 pm by Gerelyn Terzo While the markets are a sea of red, including a 2.1% drop in the Nasdaq Composite, there are some gainers if you dig deep enough. We found a few, including: eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) is up 2.5% on the day and is inching closer to its 52-week high of approximately $71 per share. The online auction platform could be gaining from a newly announced partnership with Checkout.com for payments. Bitcoin stock MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) is tacking on 1.2% today while the bitcoin price continues to hover below the $85,000 level. On its best day, bitcoin serves as an inflationary hedge from the economy, which stands to benefit MSTR stock. Expand Energy (Nasdaq: EXE) is gaining 1.7% as a rising energy sector lifts those boats. Tariff Fallout 10:04 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure as of mid-morning trading, with the three major stock market averages stuck in a rut. While March retails sales rose a higher than expected 1.4%, the markets are obsessed with Nvidia (Nasdaq; NVDA), which warned that it will take a massive $5.5 billion charge for processor exports to China, giving the markets their &#8216;I told you so&#8217; moment. Magnificent Seven stocks are each down in the ballpark of 2% this morning, including Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), whose market cap has dipped below the $3 trillion threshold. The markets are under pressure out of the gate despite stronger than anticipated economic data. All three of the major stock market averages are trading in the red, including a 1.7% drop in the Nasdaq Composite, which is being weighed down by Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA). On the flip side, Applied Digital (Nasdaq: APLD) is gaining 5% today, bucking the otherwise downward trend, on the heels of its fiscal Q3 results. Despite missing Wall Street&#8217;s expectations, Applied Digital is benefiting from its roll in data center infrastructure for AI and high-performance computing, two white-hot tech trends. The gold price is rising 2.4% today to $3,319.30 per ounce as investors flock to the inflationary hedge during these times of heightened uncertainty. Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) is gaining 4% on the day as a beneficiary of the gold rush. The technology sector is being dragged lower by NVDA stock after the company revealed an upcoming $5.5 billion charge related to chip exports to China, igniting trade war selling once again. Nvidia shares are sinking 5.6% today. Most sectors of the economy are down, including a 2.4% decline for technology, while energy stocks are up by 1%. Each of the Magnificent 7 stocks is lower today. Retail sales grew by 1.4% in March, stronger than the expected 1.2% increase and providing yet another sign of a resilient U.S. consumer. Results excluding auto sales also beat economist projections, coming in at 0.5% vs. estimates of 0.3% even in the face of tariff uncertainty targeting the auto sector. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 165.73 (-0.41%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 292.95 (-1.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 47.89 (-0.90%) Market Movers BofA analysts have reiterated their &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Nvidia stock, but it&#8217;s doing little to lift sentiment in shares today. The Wall Street firm also lowered their price target on NVDA to $160 from $200 per share, blaming tariff uncertainty. Oppenheimer analysts have begun coverage on new stock Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) with an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating attached. Piper Sandler likes Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stock, reiterating its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on the EV maker while lowering the price target from $450 to $400 per share.

      "title": "Donald Trump Campaigned on Cutting Corporate Taxes – Where Does That Promise Stand Today?",
      "content": "President Donald J. Trump’s 2024 electoral campaign was buoyed by the hope that his leadership would return the economic prosperity of his previous term, which had been decimated by Bidenomics and rampant Congressional spending, fueling inflation to the worst levels in 40 years. Central to President Trump’s strong economic performance from 2016-2020 was the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. TCHA resulted in unprecedented business growth, new entrepreneurism, historically low unemployment among all ethnic groups, and consumer confidence soaring to an 18-year high. The 21% corporate rate is one of the few permanent aspects to TCJA not subject to expiration. President Trump has been adamant about the need to renew TCJA, as other key provisions expire in December, 2025. He is also proposing additional tax cuts, such as taxes on overtime, tips, Social Security payments, and has even proposed eliminating federal income tax altogether, to be replaced with revenues from a national consumption tax and tariffs. However, analysts have debated the merits of further tax cuts, the impact on the national debt, and whether or not Congress would ultimately be able to legislate these proposals into law. Key Points The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) delivered unprecedented business growth and entrepreneurism, in addition to additional retained money in the pockets of a majority of American citizens. President Trump campaigned on cutting taxes further on a number of fronts, including renewal of TCJA before its expiration in December, 2025. Many analysts who have debated over the effectiveness of further tax cuts fail to include the massive regulatory cuts, the large pending reductions in wasteful spending being identified by DOGE, and the resultant job creation, business growth, and fresh investment into US business as a result of the tariff policies.

Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Arguments Against Tax Cuts and The Truth Senator Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is one of the main opponents to tax cuts and reduced spending that take away power from Democrats&#8217; pet projects. Not surprisingly, the entirety of elected Democrats, as well as left-leaning Republicans, have been the loudest voices against cutting taxes. Democrat leaders like Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have been among the more articulate critics, although their mantras about “tax cuts would only be for the top 1%” and that “the rich don’t pay their fair share” have been thoroughly debunked by genuine statistics and even left leaning Factcheck.org. In actuality, TCJA benefited over 75% of all US taxpayers, and it has been verified that the top 1%, in fact, pay 40% of the entirety of federal income tax. The Congressional Budget Office’s analysis projects that a TCJA extension would create increased deficits based on reduced tax revenues from present levels. It forecasts a $4.6 trillion shortfall over 10 years, accounting for interest on outstanding federal debt. The Tax Policy Center projected that economic growth would offset only 6% of the shortfall. One crucial point is that neither the CBO or TPC prognostications take into account any significant spending cuts nor how tariffs will accelerate cutting deficits, as well as other key policy ramifications already in effect in the Trump Administration: How tariffs are creating fresh US investment, new businesses, and more crucial private sector jobs. The impact of lower tax rates and the elimination of onerous Biden-imposed regulatory burdens are jump-starting new manufacturing and other major business creation. How ending potential trillions in fraudulent, misappropriated, and likely criminal spending waste from USAID and numerous other federal agencies uncovered by DOGE will accelerate the goal towards eliminating the trillions in federal debt overhang via drastically reduced spending. Why a national consumption tax effectively rebuts Democrat opponents’ claims of “unfairness” and “only favoring the rich”. Trump Fiscal Policy Results In The First 60+ Days Cutting the trillions of wasteful and criminal spending of taxpayer dollars uncovered by Elon Musk and DOGE could accelerate President Trump&#8217;s plans to fix the US economy and restore manufacturing and other critical businesses. Since taking office in January, the threat of Trump&#8217;s tariffs has already created a seismic shift in the corporate business environment. For example: In response to prospective 25% tariffs on products made in Taiwan, Taiwan Semiconductor, the maker of all of the GPUs from Nvidia and AMD required to run Artificial Intelligence, announced a $100 billion investment into new factories to be located in AZ for making GPUs and other semiconductor products expressly for the US market. SoftBank Group Corp. from Japan pledged to invest $50 billion in the US to create 50,000 new jobs. Apple announced it invested $500 billion for AI servers to be built in Michigan and Texas, creating 20,000 new jobs. Oracle, ChatGPT, and OpenAI announced its Stargate JV would invest up to $500 billion for AI infrastructure construction, creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs in various states, commencing with Texas. The revival of US-manufactured steel and copper is already underway, thanks to US tariffs to prevent dumping from China and other nations into the US market. Additionally, Elon Musk’s DOGE has been uncovering misappropriated taxpayer funds, payments to nonexistent recipients, and useless pork projects ostensibly designed to serve as political kickbacks and bribes to overseas entities, all of which are in the process of being cut. The anticipated spending cuts, something not factored into the CBO calculations, could drastically accelerate the rate of reducing the federal debt. A recent CBS poll found that 77% of the American public supports the work of DOGE. Lastly, a consumption tax, proposed as a 14-17% tax on all new goods except for food and medicine, would be a tax that visibly and unequivocally hits the wealthiest the hardest, thus debunking any accusations about unfairness. With no loopholes, a flat consumption tax is based on the value of the purchased item. Since expensive goods that are only affordable for the wealthy have a higher price tag, the commensurate tax revenues from those items will generate more tax revenues. President Trump was given a mandate by the electorate. While he has already enacted some of his plans to good effect, his tax and regulatory cutting proposals will still require much combating with Democrats, the predominant recipients of high taxes and big government spending. Over the next 4 years, the results of these battles will determine the extent of the initiatives’ full financial benefits.

      "title": "I make $700k at a FAANG company but layoffs are coming – should I sell my U.S. homes and head back to Canada?",
      "content": "Key Points A Reddit user is concerned he is going to be laid off from his $700K job. He&#8217;s considering relocating, but he likely should keep his high paying job as long as he can. Shoring up his finances and starting to network for other work could help him maintain financial stability. Earn up to 3.8% on your money today (and get a cash bonus); click here to see how. (Sponsored) A Canadian working at a FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) job is currently making $700K per year while his pregnant wife stays home with the couple&#8217;s toddler. Unfortunately, as he posted on Reddit, he&#8217;s worried about potential layoffs at his company. He wasn&#8217;t given a promotion this year as the company was laying people off, and he&#8217;s also been unable to get a visa due to the layoffs. He&#8217;s also concerned that his temporary visa could be ended because of a potential trade war between the U.S. and Canada. Given the uncertainty about his professional future, he&#8217;s trying to decide what to do. He&#8217;s thinking about potentially selling his houses in the U.S. at a small loss and resettling in Canada; about paying down his mortgage so he&#8217;d earn enough rent to cover it and temporarily going to Canada or India and renting until things stabilize in the U.S.; or about just trying to hold on at work while expanding his emergency fund. So, what&#8217;s the best approach for him to deal with his current workplace uncertainty? Shoring up his finances and work skills could be a good option While the Reddit user may be worried about future layoffs, the fact is that he has not been laid off yet &#8212; and he is still making a $700K per year income. Giving up that job in anticipation of a possible layoff that may never come would likely be a foolish move. Instead, he can focus on making himself as indispensable as possible at work. While this may not guarantee he won&#8217;t be laid off, it still gives him a better shot at staying on the job and continuing to earn great pay. He can also start polishing up his resume, networking, and making professional connections. With a FAANG job as part of his employment history, he may easily be able to find other work in the U.S. even if he is laid off from his current position. This could help him to avoid having to sell his houses and disrupt his family just because of short-term economic issues. Regardless, since his job is uncertain, shoring up his financial situation would be a smart move. He should throw as much money as possible into a high-yield savings account right now. That way, this money will be there for him to live on temporarily if he loses his job. If he does end up having to move back to Canada because of problems with his visa resulting from a trade war, it would also be helpful to have these extra funds to pay for any costs. Since he really can&#8217;t predict the future, taking these steps to be as financially secure as possible, while keeping his high-paying job for as long as he can, should help set him up for a more secure future. A financial advisor can also help him find ways to free up more money to save and can also work with him to make different contingency plans and understand how they would impact his finances, so getting this professional advice would likely be a smart choice given the uncertainty of his ongoing situation.

      "title": "I have $3,000 to invest: Should I go all in on SCHD or mix it with VOO?",
      "content": "The market climate at the time of this writing can be described in a number of ways, but “boring” is certainly not one of them. Ever since President Donald Trump announced his policy of reciprocal tariffs to level the international trade playing field, the stock and bond markets have both become cyclonic in their volatility. 2,000+ point intraday swings in either direction on the Dow Jones Average and a 50 basis point swing for the 10-year Treasury Bond yield in less than a month have given even veteran investors bouts of nausea. As a result, investors from all levels of experience are looking at their portfolios and considering reassessment of their holdings, at least to better handle the current volatility and to reduce the sleepless nights of worry. Key Points The current turbulence in the stock markets are giving both novice and seasoned investors some cause for reconsidering their portfolio compositions. ETFs like SCHD have aspects like dividend focus, which may make them less volatile than ones like VOO, which exclusively tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index. People who are new to investing can find the gigantic menu of choices overwhelming and intimidating, so knowing one’s own goals and risk tolerance before selecting an investment vehicle is a prudent rule of thumb to follow. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Navigating Through A Huge Menu Of Selections The huge array of available investment selections can be intimidating and overwhelming neophyte investors. A relatively new investor with $3,000 to invest was seeking vehicle suggestions, and posted a question on Reddit. He was considering the following, but was open to any other suggestions: He was considering investing in the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE: SCHD) based on what he’d read from other posts. The poster was looking to contribute $100 per week to take advantage of compounding and dollar cost averaging. Admittedly young and inexperienced, he did understand how investing for the long-term was to his advantage, so he was not seeking quick, short-term gains. He was concerned with putting all of his cookies in a single basket, so was inquiring about opinions on diversifying an allocation into the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO). To his credit, the poster realizes now that the Millennial FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) meme of “VOO and chill” might not be an appropriate direction to take in the current climate. Nevertheless, he acknowledges the long-term track record of the S&amp;P 500 and how it has benefited millions who have contributed to it regularly and let it compound to build wealth. As the poster has already established long term goals, assessing risk tolerance is probably the next factor to identify before finalizing his course of action. Taking a closer look at SCHD and VOO is probably a prudent step to accomplish this step. (All market quote details are as of the time of this writing.)

As one might expect, a number of the respondents agreed that some diversification was a good idea, as was the plan to invest a new contribution every week. Some of the the specifics included: Due to his youth, some suggested that it would behoove the poster to focus more on growth, and suggested SCHG (Schwab Large Cap Growth ETF), which has a superior ROI history over SCHD. In either case, reinvesting dividends to leverage compounding over the long haul was advised. Some lauded the dividend consideration, since the extra income could serve as a safety net in the event that the poster’s job were to be in jeopardy in the future. Another respondent agreed with adding VOO, but also including an ETF for international exposure so that in the event of a US economic downturn, there would be non-US holdings that could potentially offset any bearishness from the other holdings.
