      "content": "Among major market indices, the S&amp;P 500 is the go-to index for the broader stock market. It represents 500 of the top companies that trade in the stock market based on their market capitalizations. But on a global scale, the S&amp;P 500 isn&#8217;t the only game in town and arguably could take a page out of India&#8217;s comparable index — the Nifty 50 — for even better results. Indian stocks have several tailwinds, including rising investments into the Southeast Asian region. Last year thrust the Nifty 50 into the spotlight when it began beating the S&amp;P 500 on returns, and now investors are wondering if they might be missing out. It&#8217;s not that the S&amp;P 500 has a poor track record. It has gained a reputation as the go-to index for market exposure, comparisons and ETF tracking. It&#8217;s components set the standard for quarterly earnings performance, dividends and returns. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 carries more than three-quarters of the total stock market&#8217;s value, and it is held by investors big and small either through direct exposure or investment funds. We&#8217;re talking about high-flying names like NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), to name a few. Over the five-year stretch leading up to 2024, the S&amp;P 500 delivered average yearly returns of 13.6%, or 8.9% adjusted for inflation. While it&#8217;s nothing to balk at, India&#8217;s market has growth on its side. India&#8217;s Nifty 50 is a younger, more nimble index that has the ability to do things that a larger index in a greater economy is not in a position to easily replicate. With names like Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank and Tata Consultancy, the Southeast Asian index has a great deal of growth to offer investors. Key Points in This Article: Emerging economies present tremendous upside potential as American equities face unprecedented uncertainty. One analysis suggests a return of nearly 700% for the Nifty 50 index in dollar terms vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 321% over the past 25 years.

Nifty 50 Mechanics Serving as India’s premier stock market index, the Nifty 50 is the cornerstone benchmark for the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Its function is similar to that of the S&amp;P 500 in the U.S., acting as a measure of the Indian equity market’s overall performance while also reflecting investor sentiment. Since its debut in the mid-1990s, India&#8217;s index has tracked the performance of 50 of the biggest and most actively traded Indian companies on the NSE. Performance It feels counterintuitive to bet against the U.S. stock market, so that is not the purpose of this argument. Nevertheless, the Nifty 50 has had an impressive run of late. Over the past couple of decades, the Nifty 50 has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in certain analyses. While a basic comparison might be influenced by currency fluctuations, studies that adjust for the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar reveal the Nifty 50 delivering higher returns than the U.S. index. One analysis, in particular, suggests a return of nearly 700% for the Nifty 50 index in dollar terms vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 321% over the past 25 years. Much of this outperformance has unfolded over the past five years or so while India&#8217;s GDP has been expanding quickly amid policy support as well as domestic and international investment, which has widened the gap dramatically. For investors seeking to capitalize on a rapidly expanding economy, the Nifty 50 has arguably been a more compelling vehicle. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s important to note that the Indian economy is coming from a lower base than that of the U.S. economy and therefore also carries with it greater risk. The U.S. economy is valued at $27.7 trillion compared with India&#8217;s GDP of approximately $3.6 trillion. Smaller Cohort Secondly, you can argue that the Nifty 50 offers a more focused, high-quality play on India&#8217;s elite corporate sector. As an index of only 50 companies, it represents only the biggest and most liquid companies on the National Stock Exchange. This makes it a useful benchmark for investors who want exposure to India’s blue-chip leaders. These include stable, leading players in key sectors like financial services, technology and energy. For a new investor in the Indian market, this smaller, more focused list can be easier to understand and follow. Lower Base Finally, while the S&amp;P 500 represents a mature, developed market, the Nifty 50 is a direct bet on a still-developing economy with a GDP that is growing by leaps and bounds. This offers the potential for greater growth. Despite some of the volatility that comes with emerging market status, the Nifty 50 is seen as a key indicator of India’s economic health, and its performance has reflected the country’s strong growth of late. This combination of stability among its top companies and exposure to a high-growth economy makes for a compelling investment thesis.

      "title": "Jim Cramer Is Fixated On An International Rotation",
      "content": "One of the world’s most prolific talking heads around the stock market, Jim Cramer needs little introduction in the financial world. The host of MAD MONEY on CNBC, Cramer, has been in the investing and media game for years, and for the most part, he’s got his pulse on the market better than most. Key Points Jim Cramer is taking a long, hard look at some European names that have been overlooked. His take is that Europe has been overlooked for too long, and some major brands are experiencing financial growth in the region. Camer wholeheartedly believes that ignoring Europe would mean ignoring financial gains. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement?

Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) A continent with nearly 750 million people, Cramer believes this region of the world has been overlooked for far too long. Indicating that this region is on the rise, his take is that the state of Europe is very strong, something heavyweight giants like the CEO of Cisco support wholeheartedly. Europe Is Coming Back There is no question that Cramer, who believes Wall Street has overlooked Europe unnecessarily, is fixated on the region&#8217;s sudden rise and the belief that a host of companies are experiencing significant success. Cramer notes that there has been an increase in spending, particularly in the technology sector, across Europe. He highlights that even the telecom companies, which have generally been adverse to big spending in the region, are now opening up their wallets in a meaningful and impactful way. His concern is that Wall Street has ignored Europe for far too long. Still, Portugal, Italy, Spain, and numerous other countries in the European region are now directly on Cramer’s radar. Amazon (AMZN) When it comes to Amazon, Cramer specifically highlights that the company has been losing money in Europe for as long as he can remember. Now, the company has turned the corner, showing at least one billion in profit in the last quarter alone, just from European sales. He also thinks that the stock is on the rise, specifically because investors are seeing the growth potential in Europe. According to online research, Amazon has a market penetration of at least 64% in Germany and approximately 50% of the online market in Spain. This is before you turn your attention to France, where 35% of the spending shoppers do online goes to Amazon. In Italy, nearly 70% of all online spending is directed to Amazon, which further supports Jim’s point that Amazon is a must-watch stock in Europe. Apple (AAPL) When you consider that Apple saw a 10% increase in iPhone shipments in Europe in the first quarter of 2025, despite a worldwide decline, it’s another reason in favor of Cramer’s outlook on the company. This led to almost a billion dollars in profit for the first quarter, similar to Amazon&#8217;s, just in Europe. Cramer indicates that nobody saw this coming, and yet, it’s a telling sign that Apple is seeing these kinds of numbers in the market. Burberry (BURBY) Burberry, headquartered in London, recently announced that it was laying off 20% of its global workforce, but this didn’t stop its stock from jumping in response. On June 25, 2025, the company highlighted that Q1 sales were proof that its resilience in the market was no fluke. It also expects the first quarter of its 2026 financial year to outperform the fourth quarter of 2025, which boosts Cramer&#8217;s argument about these specific companies. Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) European telecom giant Deutsche Telekom is also back on the rise, especially in light of its recent signing a deal with NVIDIA to establish an AI cloud for European manufacturers in Germany. NVIDIA said it will supply at least 10,000 chips to be used in Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s data centers, which is a win for both companies and demonstrates that DT is no longer hesitant to invest significantly. Cramer specifically highlights this willingness to open its wallet as a reason to keep an eye on this stock. ASML (ASML) Another company on Cramer’s radar is ASML, a Dutch multinational corporation specializing in the semiconductor industry, which is poised for significant financial growth. The company is standing by its reduced forecast from a month ago, but Cramer doesn’t think anyone is properly paying attention to the stock. He says this is one to watch.

      "title": "Jim Cramer: ‘Trump Discount’ Is Hurting Markets",
      "content": "Key Points in This Article: CNBC’s Mad Money host Jim Cramer is often criticized for inaccurate stock picks that inspire routine bets against his calls as a better way to beat the market. Due to his unreliable predictions and over-the-top policy complaints, investors would be better served by focusing on company fundamentals. Nvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of &#8216;Next Nvidia Stocks&#8217; that could be even better. Click here to learn more. A Controversial Track Record Jim Cramer is a polarizing figure in financial media, known for hosting CNBC’s Mad Money and co-anchoring Squawk on the Street. A Harvard-educated former hedge fund manager, Cramer’s high-energy stock picks and market commentary have made him a household name among retail investors. However, his predictions are frequently criticized for their inconsistency, with many noting he’s often wrong about his stock calls. This reputation led to the creation of the Inverse Cramer ETF, which aimed to profit by betting against his recommendations. Although the ETF shut down due to lack of interest, an X account named “Inverse Cramer” continues to mock his calls, highlighting his spotty track record. Cramer’s bold, sometimes erratic takes &#8212; such a a recent essay he wrote on a so-called “Trump discount” &#8212; often spark debate, with critics pointing to his tendency to overemphasize short-term noise over long-term fundamentals, making his advice a risky bet for investors. Cramer’s “Trump Discount” Thesis In his June 1 article, Jim Cramer argues that a “Trump discount” is suppressing U.S. stock market performance due to the unpredictability of President Trump’s policies. He contrasts Europe’s “consistency of mediocrity” with U.S. volatility, claiming the White House’s immense power creates instability. Cramer cites examples across sectors: Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) gains were short-lived due to policy uncertainty; retail stocks like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) face tariff-related confusion; drug companies suffer from shifting Medicare pricing policies and vaccine skepticism; food companies like Campbell’s (NYSE:CPB) face regulatory pressure from RFK Jr.; Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) struggles with Trump’s push for U.S.-only manufacturing; software and internet giants like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) face unexpected scrutiny; banks see no regulatory relief; mergers and acquisitions are stalled by unpredictable cash flows; and energy stocks, despite Trump’s pro-drilling stance, lack momentum due to high costs and regulatory hurdles. Cramer predicts continued market declines, noting a recent 1% S&amp;P 500 drop, exacerbated by mixed signals about U.S.-China trade talks. Flaws in Cramer’s Argument Cramer’s thesis appears flawed for several reasons. First, his “Trump discount” overstates the impact of presidential policies on broad market performance. The S&amp;P 500, far from being discounted, has gained since he wrote his article, and is near record highs, contradicting his bearish outlook. Second, his sector-specific arguments lack depth. Nvidia’s volatility is more tied to market cycles and competition than Trump’s policies. Retailers like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and TJX (NYSE:TJX) have thrived despite tariff fears, with Costco’s stock rising due to strong fundamentals, not a “Trump premium.” Third, Cramer’s focus on short-term policy noise ignores long-term drivers like corporate earnings and consumer demand. His concerns about drug stocks, which he ties to RFK Jr.’s influence, overstate the impact of unconfirmed regulatory changes, since Medicare negotiation frameworks remain complex and slow-moving. Similarly, his critique of Apple misinterprets global supply chain dynamics; India’s manufacturing shift is a strategic diversification, not a policy misstep. Cramer’s Track Record and Market Misreads Cramer’s historical inaccuracy fuels skepticism. The Inverse Cramer ETF, though defunct, capitalized on his poor track record, and the ongoing X account highlights his frequent misses. His alarmist tone, comparing Trump’s influence to Andrew Jackson’s era, exaggerates political impact while downplaying market resilience. For instance, energy stocks’ stagnation is less about Trump’s policies and more about global oil prices and ESG pressures, which Cramer barely addresses. His claim that Europe’s markets outperform due to “consistency” ignores their own challenges, like Germany’s 2025 economic slowdown. By fixating on sensationalized policy risks, Cramer overlooks broader market trends, such as technology-driven gains and robust consumer spending, which have propelled the S&amp;P 500 upward. Key Takeaways As always, focus on fundamentals, not noise. Investors should tune out sky-is-falling narratives like Cramer’s, which amplify short-term concerns over fundamentals. However, blind optimism about endless market gains is equally misguided. Markets naturally rise and fall, influenced by policies but driven by earnings, innovation, and economic cycles. While presidential actions, like tariffs or deregulation, can create volatility, they don’t dictate long-term outcomes. Investors would do well to focus on business fundamentals &#8212; revenue growth, profit margins, and competitive advantages &#8212; rather than reacting to pundits like Cramer. Consistent, long-term investing, diversified across sectors, remains the most reliable path to wealth creation, regardless of political headlines.

Apple Stock Bump 11:10 am by Gerelyn Terzo Bank of America analysts have reaffirmed their &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock, pointing to the App Store results as a positive catalyst. Earlier this week, Jefferies analysts lifted their outlook on Apple shares to &#8220;hold&#8221; from &#8220;underperform.&#8221; Apple stock is up 0.78% today but is down 14% year-to-date. Fed in Focus 9:58 am by Gerelyn Terzo With today&#8217;s strong jobs data, indicating a healthy economy, Wall Street analysts are predicting what to expect when Fed policymakers convene next. Here&#8217;s a roundup of some of the commentary: BMO&#8217;s Ian Lyngen remarked, “Overall, it was a strong set of data that implies the Fed will remain on hold later this month, leaving rate cut expectations focused on the September FOMC meeting.” Mutual of America Capital Management CEO Joe Gaffoglio wrote, “The June jobs report continues to demonstrate resilience across the labor market, even as certain sectors such as manufacturing continue to lag. The unemployment rate is holding steady at 4.1%, and real average hourly earnings for employees experienced its largest increase of the year.” Goldman Sachs&#8217; Head of Fixed Income Macro Strategies Simon Dangoor commented: “Today’s stronger jobs report confirms a still resilient U.S. labor market, defying, at least for now, the signs of weakness seen in some leading indicators. The FOMC’s conviction that it should hold its wait-and-see stance while it braces for an acceleration in inflation over the summer will only be strengthened. But we still see a path to a resumption of the Fed’s easing cycle later in the year should the summer acceleration in inflation prove more modest than expected.” This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are celebrating a stronger-than-expected jobs report for June, sending all three of the major stock market indices higher. The economy added 147,000 payrolls last month, far outpacing economist forecasts calling for a slowdown in hiring. Meanwhile, past data was revised upward, while the unemployment rate dropped from 4.2% to 4.1%, once again outshining most expectations. The Nasdaq Composite is on pace for yet another record high, as is the broader S&amp;P 500 market index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.28%. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green today, led by telecom, consumer discretionary and technology. Big Tech is driving much of the gains in the Nasdaq Composite today, including a 2% rise in Meta Technologies (Nasdaq: META) amid an analyst upgrade at Needham, which has assigned a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the stock, up from &#8220;underperform.&#8221; Elon Musk weighed in on X, asking in delight, &#8220;They had a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating on Zuck?&#8221; Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 149.16 (+0.34%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 125.10 (+0.61%) S&amp;P 500: Up 29.48 (+0.48%) Market Movers Datadog (Nasdaq: DDOG), which is behind a cloud-based security platform, is advancing 9.1% today after being chosen as the latest addition to the S&amp;P 500, replacing the outgoing Juniper Networks, which is being acquired by Hewlett Packard (NYSE: HPE). With the index inclusion, DDOG will gain exposure to more institutional and retail portfolios including through ETFs. Synopsys (Nasdaq: SNPS) is gaining 4.4% after the U.S. withdrew U.S. &#8220;chip design software curbs on China,&#8221; per reports. Tripadvisor (Nasdaq: TRIP) is soaring 11.5% today on the heels of an investment by activist investor Starboard, which after taking a 9% position in the stock called the shares undervalued.

Despite past concerns over China restrictions, Nvidia&#8217;s dominant 92% market share in AI GPUs and upward revenue guidance ($44B for the quarter) continue to sustain bullish momentum.

Again, it&#8217;s I think they&#8217;re up to 3.27 trillion. They passed Microsoft. Interesting. Does that count [00:00:17] Lee Jackson: how much their core weave is up? Yes. [00:00:21] Doug McIntyre: Yes. Now it did something else. And that is, their, Mr. [00:00:25] Doug McIntyre: Huang, their CEO Yes. Is now worth $135 billion. So he was helped out by that as well. Was he ever? Yeah, so I mean, this stock has rallied almost 40%. it hit that, tremendous low in March and it&#8217;s had a ridiculous rally since then. It&#8217;s up like [00:00:49] Lee Jackson: 66%. Yeah, it traded down to almost 90 didn&#8217;t it? [00:00:53] Lee Jackson: Back in April or the, at the very low. [00:00:56] Doug McIntyre: Well, and, at that point, the comment was, is that a big worry about the fact that there was $50 billion that they couldn&#8217;t get because they were being shut out of China by Trump. So I guess their earnings, plus all these announcements about, AI server farms, I think by my calculation, the amount of money in aggregate that&#8217;s going to be invested in AI server farms is about $600 billion. [00:01:27] Doug McIntyre: If you take Microsoft and Meta and OpenAI, what people have said they will spend to build these things. So I think it&#8217;s gonna be [00:01:35] Lee Jackson: more than that. The, place that,or Meta&#8217;s built building in Louisiana is like a whole county. [00:01:43] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. So let&#8217;s just say that&#8217;s the low end. But if you add all those things together. [00:01:49] Doug McIntyre: I think what you get is the impression that they&#8217;re not gonna have any trouble selling, chips at all. No, and listen, there, the one thing about their earnings is that they guided, to 44 billion for this quarter. Right. So that implies that they would be up in revenue another 60 or 70%, quarter over previously years quarter. [00:02:17] Doug McIntyre: and what that means is that their mon momentum stays, from a revenue standpoint, roughly the same. They&#8217;ve got 92% market share. Right now, AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) is second with about, I dunno, six. listen, all companies are stoppable at some point e every, everybody reaches a wall. [00:02:40] Lee Jackson: Yep, they will. They will, [00:02:42] Doug McIntyre: but they haven&#8217;t yet. [00:02:43] Doug McIntyre: So that&#8217;s why. Well, [00:02:45] Lee Jackson: and it, [00:02:46] Lee Jackson: doesn&#8217;t appear, especially based upon, to your point. The addition of all these server farms it&#8217;s everywhere. it&#8217;s all across the country. So yeah, the, I think they have, there&#8217;s some more tailwind to, this rally, but again, we&#8217;re getting near the end of literally a 20% bounce back. [00:03:07] Lee Jackson: So it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how it trades from here. [00:03:10] Doug McIntyre: Well, they&#8217;re also, I think, sort of being helped psychologically by the fact that all the other, with one or two exceptions, all the other big tech stocks have also bounced back. And since so many of them, the impression investors have is that all of these are AI proxies. [00:03:27] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. Yeah. in one way or another, everybody on the list, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), they&#8217;re all, listen Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), that Tesla is now an AI play in the minds of investors, and that&#8217;s why market cap is so much higher than the other car companies. So Nvidia has benefited from two things. It looks like it&#8217;s in great shape and China doesn&#8217;t matter. [00:03:52] Doug McIntyre: And it looks like everybody else is in great shape who wants to be in this business and the people in the private capital is still going into these companies. Yeah, [00:04:05] Lee Jackson: I haven&#8217;t seen a stock like this since the nineties, so I really haven&#8217;t that I can, at least I can think of. I mean, back when everybody would wait for Intel&#8217;s (NASDAQ: INTC) numbers or everybody would wait for Microsoft Numbers or some microsystems or whatever back then, but I haven&#8217;t seen anything like this in a very long time. [00:04:24] Lee Jackson: Yeah. [00:04:26] Doug McIntyre: I&#8217;m gonna say that I think that it still has room to run. I mean, I know that it&#8217;s up by really a ludicrous percentage amount. It&#8217;s at a high, the market cap, 65% off that April low, but I, there&#8217;s no news that&#8217;s gonna stop this until earnings. The China thing is baked. China&#8217;s baked in, right? [00:04:49] Doug McIntyre: Good earnings are baked in. Every time there&#8217;s another, a server farm announcement, nobody&#8217;s surprised. It&#8217;s if you said to me that, OpenAI was gonna open a server farm in Canada and they were gonna spend, a hundred billion dollars, like, okay, sure. that&#8217;s par for the course. [00:05:08] Doug McIntyre: I&#8217;m not surprised at all. So [00:05:10] Lee Jackson: yeah, it&#8217;s really become so, and it&#8217;s interesting though, even though technology has led this big bounce, four of the Mag seven, I think we&#8217;re still down a week ago. I mean, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was down, Tesla was down and, for this year, and I was kind of surprised when I saw that, but boy, it, has been a just a ripped the shorts head off kind of rally that I haven&#8217;t seen in years. [00:05:36] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. So, that takes along with it, the markets are basically at an all time high. Yeah. And so, no surprising, you&#8217;ve got some of these big cap companies, they&#8217;re leading the rally as has happened, the last leg up on this before you had some sell down. It&#8217;s the same companies leading this rally up, so. [00:06:01] Doug McIntyre: Yep, yep. I mean, that&#8217;s the news in this segment. You&#8217;ve got, Wong becoming one of the richest people in the world. You&#8217;ve got the market cap up and you&#8217;ve got all the reasons why it is up, so. [00:06:13] Lee Jackson: yep. And, it&#8217;s the old don&#8217;t want to be the last one in the door versus don&#8217;t wanna not have it in your portfolio if you&#8217;re a pm, Yeah. So it&#8217;s, like you&#8217;re, caught between a rock and a hard place here. [00:06:26] The post Nvidia (NVDA) Doesn&#8217;t Care About China Anymore appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",
