Tu es un stratège senior en allocation d'actifs au sein d'une société de gestion de renom.

Tu reçois plusieurs types de données financières :
1. **Thèmes dominants** extraits de plus de 100 articles économiques (structurés par thème, région, secteur)
2. **Actualités à fort impact** (Top 100 globales, scorées par importance, en format synthétisé)
3. **Données marché actuelles** (indices, taux, spreads, etc.)
4. **Performances sectorielles récentes**

🎯 **Objectif** : Produire un **brief stratégique à destination d'un comité d'investissement**, clair, synthétique et orienté allocation.

---

🗓️ Nous sommes la semaine du 27 June 2025. Tu peux utiliser cette information temporelle pour contextualiser tes scénarios (FOMC, échéances, saison des résultats...).

---

🎓 **Tes missions** :

- Identifier les grandes **dynamiques macro, géopolitiques et sectorielles**
- Détailler **2 à 3 scénarios macro probables** à 3-12 mois, avec **leurs implications concrètes sur les classes d'actifs**
- Anticiper les **réactions probables des marchés** (prixant déjà certaines hypothèses)
- Détecter des **décalages perception / réalité** : où les marchés ou médias se trompent-ils ?
- Générer **des recommandations actionnables** sur l'allocation (secteurs, zones, classes d'actifs)
- Utiliser les données de marché et sectorielles comme points de repère factuels dans tes anticipations
- Identifier les risques clés qui pourraient modifier les scénarios présentés
- Lister les métriques et événements importants à surveiller dans les semaines à venir
- Intégrer des chiffres clés des données de marché et sectorielles pour renforcer l'analyse
- Formuler une recommandation explicite sur la position en liquidité/cash à maintenir

---

📐 **Structure du brief attendue** :

1. **Macroéconomie** – Tendances globales, scénarios, causalité économique (ex : "Si X ⇒ alors Y ⇒ impact Z")
   - Pour chaque scénario, AJOUTE UN TITRE EXPLICITE, par exemple : 
     * Scénario 1 : "Récession modérée" (probabilité élevée)
     * Scénario 2 : "Stabilisation progressive" (probabilité moyenne)
     * Scénario 3 : "Rebond optimiste" (probabilité faible)

2. **Marchés** – Où en est-on dans le cycle ? Que price le marché ? Quelles rotations sectorielles probables ?
   - INTÈGRE DES CHIFFRES CLÉS, comme "Les indices boursiers ont perdu en moyenne -3% cette semaine" ou "le taux 10 ans US est descendu à 3,25%"

3. **Secteurs** – Surperformance / sous-performance attendue
   - CITE DES DONNÉES CONCRÈTES, par exemple "Le secteur technologique a surperformé de +5,2% le mois dernier"

4. **Régions clés** – États-Unis, Europe, Asie, Emergents : quelles zones sur / sous-performent ?

5. **Implications pour l'investisseur** – Synthèse claire avec recommandations (actions value ? matières premières ? obligations longues ?)
   - INCLURE UNE POSITION SUR LA LIQUIDITÉ/CASH, par exemple "Maintenir 15% de liquidités pour saisir les opportunités en cas de correction"

6. 🧠 **Anticipations vs Réalité** – Mets en évidence 2 ou 3 endroits où la perception du marché semble erronée, et ce que cela implique.

7. 🔺 **Risques clés** – Quels sont les 3 à 5 principaux risques à surveiller ?

8. 📊 **Facteurs déterminants du marché** – Quelles seront les métriques ou annonces à suivre dans les semaines à venir ?

---

⚠️ **Niveau d'exigence** :

- Sois **stratégique et synthétique** (max ~800 tokens)
- Utilise des **chaînes de raisonnement** (pas seulement des constats)
- Distingue **court terme (1-3 mois)** vs **moyen terme (6-12 mois)**
- Intègre la **composante comportementale** : que price déjà le marché ? quelles attentes sont risquées ?
- IMPORTANT: En conclusion, inclure **3 convictions majeures avec une nuance temporelle précise**:
  - Utiliser des mois précis plutôt que "3 prochains mois" (ex: "Entre mai et juillet 2025")
  - Ajouter une raison d'action immédiate et lier à des événements spécifiques
  - Exemple amélioré: "Entre avril et juin, les obligations longues offrent un couple rendement/risque attractif en anticipation d'une détente monétaire début été."

## Résultat

# Brief Stratégique pour le Comité d'Investissement

### 1. Macroéconomie

**Scénario 1 : "Stagflation persistante" (probabilité élevée)**  
*Si les tarifs douaniers continuent de peser sur l'activité économique et que l'inflation reste élevée, alors la Fed pourrait retarder ses baisses de taux, ce qui pourrait entraîner une stagnation de la croissance et une inflation persistante, impactant négativement les marchés boursiers.*

**Scénario 2 : "Récession modérée" (probabilité moyenne)**  
*Si la Fed commence à réduire les taux en réponse à une économie en ralentissement, alors cela pourrait soutenir temporairement les marchés, mais une récession pourrait se matérialiser, affectant les bénéfices des entreprises.*

**Scénario 3 : "Rebond optimiste" (probabilité faible)**  
*Si la Fed réduit les taux de manière significative tout en stimulant la croissance, alors les marchés pourraient connaître un rebond, mais cela semble peu probable compte tenu des pressions inflationnistes.*

### 2. Marchés

Actuellement, les indices boursiers montrent une résilience, avec le S&P 500 à 6 141,02 (+0,80 %) et le Nasdaq à 20 167,91 (+0,97 %). Cependant, les marchés semblent déjà intégrer une attente de baisses de taux, ce qui pourrait créer des déceptions si la Fed ne suit pas.

### 3. Secteurs

- **Technologie** : Surperformance attendue, avec des entreprises comme Apple et Microsoft montrant des signes de solidité. Le secteur a enregistré une hausse de 6,53 % YTD.
- **Énergie** : Bien que le secteur ait connu une hausse de 1,57 % récemment, il reste sous pression en raison des incertitudes géopolitiques.
- **Consommation discrétionnaire** : Sous-performance anticipée, avec des indices automobiles en baisse de 16,59 % YTD.

### 4. Régions clés

- **États-Unis** : Montée des tensions autour des tarifs et des politiques économiques, mais les marchés restent relativement stables.
- **Europe** : L'inflation a chuté à 1,9 %, offrant une marge de manœuvre à la BCE pour des baisses de taux potentielles.
- **Asie** : La Chine montre des signes de croissance modérée, mais les tensions commerciales avec les États-Unis pèsent sur les perspectives.

### 5. Implications pour l'investisseur

- **Actions Value** : Favoriser les secteurs défensifs comme la santé et les services publics.
- **Obligations** : Envisager des obligations à long terme en anticipation d'une détente monétaire potentielle.
- **Liquidités** : Maintenir 15 % de liquidités pour saisir les opportunités en cas de correction.

### 6. Anticipations vs Réalité
