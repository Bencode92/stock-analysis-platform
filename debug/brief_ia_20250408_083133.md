Tu es un stratège senior en allocation d'actifs au sein d'une société de gestion de renom.

Tu reçois deux types de données financières :
1. **Thèmes dominants** extraits de plus de 100 articles économiques (structurés par thème, région, secteur)
2. **Actualités à fort impact** (Top 70 globales, scorées par importance)

🎯 **Objectif** : Produire un **brief stratégique à destination d'un comité d'investissement**, clair, synthétique et orienté allocation.

---

🗓️ Nous sommes la semaine du 08 April 2025. Tu peux utiliser cette information temporelle pour contextualiser tes scénarios (FOMC, échéances, saison des résultats...).

---

🎓 **Tes missions** :

- Identifier les grandes **dynamiques macro, géopolitiques et sectorielles**
- Détailler **2 à 3 scénarios macro probables** à 3-12 mois, avec **leurs implications concrètes sur les classes d'actifs**
- Anticiper les **réactions probables des marchés** (prixant déjà certaines hypothèses)
- Détecter des **décalages perception / réalité** : où les marchés ou médias se trompent-ils ?
- Générer **des recommandations actionnables** sur l'allocation (secteurs, zones, classes d'actifs)

---

📐 **Structure du brief attendue** :

1. **Macroéconomie** – Tendances globales, scénarios, causalité économique (ex : "Si X ⇒ alors Y ⇒ impact Z")
2. **Marchés** – Où en est-on dans le cycle ? Que price le marché ? Quelles rotations sectorielles probables ?
3. **Secteurs** – Surperformance / sous-performance attendue
4. **Régions clés** – États-Unis, Europe, Asie, Emergents : quelles zones sur / sous-performent ?
5. **Implications pour l'investisseur** – Synthèse claire avec recommandations (actions value ? matières premières ? obligations longues ?)
6. 🧠 **Anticipations vs Réalité** – Mets en évidence 2 ou 3 endroits où la perception du marché semble erronée, et ce que cela implique.

---

⚠️ **Niveau d'exigence** :

- Sois **stratégique et synthétique** (max ~800 tokens)
- Utilise des **chaînes de raisonnement** (pas seulement des constats)
- Distingue **court terme (1-3 mois)** vs **moyen terme (6-12 mois)**
- Intègre la **composante comportementale** : que price déjà le marché ? quelles attentes sont risquées ?
- N'oublie pas d'inclure une **conclusion avec 3 convictions majeures pour les 3 prochains mois**

    "title": "5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens on Wednesday",
    "content": "Close U.S. stock futures are pointing lower as investors ready for today's tariffs announcement expected from President Donald Trump after markets close; Tesla (TSLA) is slated to report first-quarter deliveries amid a downturn for its stock; Visa (V) reportedly is offering a payment of roughly $100 million to get Apple's (AAPL) credit card payment network business; and USDC stablecoin issuer Circle files for an IPO. Here's what investors need to know today. 1. US Stock Futures Dip as Investors Await Tariffs Updates U.S. stock futures are pointing lower following a volatile trading session as investors await White House tariff plans expected to be announced later today. Market watchers are also following today's private sector payrolls release ahead of Friday's job report. Nasdaq futures are 0.8% lower after the tech-focused index gained 0.9% Tuesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 futures are lower by about 0.5%. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is down slightly at around $85,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is down below 4.15%. Oil futures are down. Gold futures are slightly higher. 2. Investors Brace for Trump Tariffs Announcement After Markets Close President Donald Trump is set to unveil his latest tariffs proposal at a White House event slated to start at the close of markets at 4 p.m. ET. Trump's advisers continue to hash out the details surrounding the new tariffs he plans to implement ahead of the \"Liberation Day\" event, Bloomberg reported. While Trump has said he was seeking reciprocal tariffs to match import taxes on U.S.-made products, a report in The Washington Post indicated that advisers were also mulling a 20% tariff on nearly all imported products. 3. Tesla Stock Slips Ahead of Quarterly Deliveries Data Tesla (TSLA) shares are down 2.5% in premarket trading ahead of the electric vehicle maker's expected release of its first-quarter deliveries data this morning. Analysts expect Tesla to report 393,000 deliveries, up less than 2% year-over-year but fewer than last quarter's 495,570 vehicles. The data comes as analysts have raised concerns that CEO Elon Musk's work with the Trump administration is creating distractions and impacting Tesla's business. Tesla shares have shed one-third of their value in 2025. 4. Visa Offers Apple $100M to Take Over Credit Card Network, Report Says Visa (V) is offering a payment of roughly $100 million to get Apple's (AAPL) credit card network business, according to The Wall Street Journal. The report said that Apple would select a payment provider before selecting a bank to take over its credit card from Goldman Sachs (GS), and that Visa is competing with Mastercard (MA)—which is \"fiercely trying to keep its role as the network on this card\"—and American Express (AXP). The Journal previously reported that JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Synchrony Financial (SYF), Capital One (COF) and American Express were in the running to take over as the issuer of the credit card. 5. USDC Stablecoin Issuer Circle Files for IPO Circle, the company behind the dollar-backed USDC stablecoin, has filed for a U.S. initial public offering (IPO). In its prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Circle said it plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under ticker symbol \"CRCL.\" Circle, which had previously announced plans to go public in 2021 via a SPAC merger, said its 2024 net income was $155.7 million, down from $267.6 million a year earlier.

    "title": "Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Price Prediction and Forecast (March 2025)",
    "content": "Due to efforts to bolster U.S. domestic chip production and reduce reliance on overseas supply chains, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM), AKA TSMC, plans to drastically increase its investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, including new fabrication plants and advanced packaging facilities in Arizona. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) holds a crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain, commanding over 60% of global spending at chip foundries. Its ability to deliver cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities is essential for customers developing artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing, and other advanced technologies. Therefore, we see a more than 46% gain for the stock by the end of the decade. If you’re looking for some stocks with huge potential, make sure to grab a free copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. It features a software stock we’re confident has 10X potential. The stock hit an all-time high of $226.40 earlier this year but has been in retreat since then. In fact, the share price is 8.3% lower than at the start of the year. It is up 28.9% year over year, though, outperforming the broader markets in that time. Wall Street remains optimistic, and analysts see plenty of room for the stock to run, at least in the short term. Investors are of course concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. Although most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it is clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term prognostications irrelevant. 24/7 Wall St. aims to present some farther-looking insights based on TSMC’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help with your own research. All Roads Lead to Taiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor has control of roughly 62% of the global chip market. In the high-tech universe, there is a single common road that top-flight companies like Nvidia, AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and many others must travel to get their chips made, no matter where they hail from. That road inevitably leads to TSMC, the largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. When a company like Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) designs a new chip, it takes it to TSMC to actually print the design on a silicon wafer. TSMC is the top choice for Nvidia, AMD, and many other chip designers, thanks to its precision, quality control, and innovative technical capabilities. At the time of this writing, TSMC commands over 60% of global spending at chip foundries. The explosion of growth in the artificial intelligence and data center arenas have led to a commensurate demand acceleration for graphics processing unit (GPU) chips and a panoply of similar ones for those fields. By focusing on precision foundry work, TSMC has become the premier “go-to” player, for chip designers, even among those competing in various sectors. TSMC does face certain challenges, including: Despite its crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain, Taiwan Semiconductor is based in Taiwan. The Leadership of the People’s Republic of China claims that Taiwan is a part of China proper. Any overt military action on Taiwanese soil likely would result in a domino-effect of chip shortages. TSMC had raised prices for its 3-nanometer and 5-nm process products by up to 8%. However, Samsung is focusing on its 2-nm process to meet future technologies’ high-performance, low-power, and high-bandwidth requirements, and rival Intel has a 1.4-nm ultra-fine process slated to be unveiled in 2027. The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical. While AI investment soars, TSMC has few rivals of significance. During slow periods, semiconductor companies have often been glutted with excess inventory. It remains to be seen how TSMC will handle a slowdown after ramping up production to such a high level. TSMC&#8217;s Performance The company experienced significant growth and transformation from 2014 to 2024, in that time solidifying its position as a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing. 2014 was the year that the TSMC-Apple cooperation began in earnest, with Apple’s A8 and A8X SoCss. Such has the cooperation expanded that Apple has gone to TSMC for nearly 100% of its chip requirements by 2024. Opposing patent infringement lawsuits with GlobalFoundries in 2019 eventually settled with a cross-licensing agreement, which ends in 2029. 2020 saw TSMC prudently decide to diversify its manufacturing by opening up new plants in Phoenix, Arizona, and Dresden, Germany. In July 2020, TSMC signed a 20-year deal with Ørsted to buy the entire production of two offshore wind farms under development off Taiwan&#8217;s west coast. At the time of its signing, it was the world&#8217;s largest corporate green energy order ever made. 2021 saw TSMC form joint ventures with Sony and Denso in Japan. Fiscal Year (DEC ) Price Total Revenues Net Income NYSE (TWD) (TWD) 2014 $22.38 $762.81 M $254.30 M 2015 $22.75 $843.49 M $302.85 M 2016 $28.75 $947.98 M $331.73 M 2017 $39.65 $977.95 M $344.99 M 2018 $36.91 $1.03 B $363.05 M 2019 $58.10 $1.07 B $353.95 M 2020 $109.04 $1.34 B $510.74 M 2021 $120.31 $1.59 B $596.54 M 2022 $74.49 $2.24 B $1.016,53 B 2023 $104.00 $2.16 B $838.50 M 2024 $197.49 $2.89 B $1.17 T Key Drivers for TSMC’s Future The surge in artificial intelligence (AI) is a primary driver for TSMC. The surge in artificial intelligence (AI) is a primary driver for TSMC, but its future growth is also heavily tied to strategic partnerships, geopolitical considerations, and the following: Technological Leadership: TSMC&#8217;s ongoing advancement in process technology, particularly in nodes like 3nm and beyond, allows them to command premium pricing and maintain a strong market share. The company&#8217;s ability to deliver cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities is essential for customers developing advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing, and advanced mobile devices. Demand from Key Sectors: The increasing demand for semiconductors in crucial fields like AI, high-performance computing (HPC), and 5G and advanced mobile devices. While the surge in AI applications drives a need for the powerful chips TSMC manufactures, data centers and other HPC applications also require high-end semiconductors. Furthermore, the evolution of 5G and the increasing sophistication of mobile devices contribute significantly to TSMC&#8217;s revenue. Supply Chain Dynamics: The importance of robust semiconductor supply chains is undeniable, and TSMC&#8217;s role in that chain is very crucial. This serves as an incentive for the international community to keep Taiwan out of Beijing’s control. Because of its uniquely advanced manufacturing capabilities, TSMC can easily scale for demand acceleration, and it holds close to a near monopoly on large graphics processing unit (GPU) chip contracts from major semiconductor designers for AI and data center use. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 TSMC’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips that can mimic many human brain functions. The consensus recommendation for TSMC stock from 17 Wall Street analysts is to buy shares. Three of those analysts have Strong Buy ratings. Their average price target in 12 months is $247.07, which is 37.5% above the current price. 24/7 Wall St.’s 12-month projection for TSMC’s price is $183.92 a share, which signals a gain of 2.4% in the coming year. While the company is set to start its 2-nm process this year, Samsung has a vested interest in developing its own niche advantage and support from the Korean government in that space. As a result, we do not anticipate as big of a 2025 surge from 2-nm as other analysts might. Outlook for the Next 5 Years Since TSMC consumes as much as 5% of Taiwan’s entire energy output, its Ørsted wind farm energy production should manifest tangible cost savings benefits. Therefore, we project 2026’s stock price to hit $186.00, a 5.8% year-over-year retreat. While its 2-nm process will likely compete favorably at the start against Samsung, the TSMC competitive advantage in other avenues of chip manufacturing will ultimately prove to be overwhelming. The anticipated surge of data center spending on chips should fuel larger contracts. Collaborations with research institutions and tech giants in developing next-generation AI chips could open new revenue streams and strengthen its position as an innovation leader in the industry. Our projection for 2027 is $206.80. 2028 should begin to see the rewards from the 2024 R&amp;D surge of $32 billion in advanced process technologies. New products from TSM investments in quantum computing research are expected to bear fruit by 2028, potentially revolutionizing certain computing applications. The company’s focus on developing ultra-low power consumption chips for IoT and edge computing devices could position it as a key player in the growing market for energy-efficient technologies. The 2028 24/7 Wall St. price target is $213.90. 2029 will mark the expiration of TSMC’s GlobalFoundries cross-licensing agreement, which should double up the revenues from that stream. Further developments in chips for quantum computing, healthcare, and other applications can open up more direct government contract opportunities. U.S. and German TSMC factories should be operating at full capacity by 2029. We anticipate a price jump to $245.99. By 2030, TSMC&#8217;s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips at the forefront of AI applications.

    "content": "The markets are recovering from yesterday&#8217;s massive sell-off by starting today as a mixed bag. After the worst performances from the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 in several years, both indexes are showing fractional movement in either direction while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slides a bit further. Wall Street&#8217;s AI darling and a Mag 7 stock Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) is helping sentiment today, rising 2.6% at last check and lifting some of its tech peers. NVDA stock as well as Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) were helped by analysts at Bernstein, who reiterated their &#8220;outperform&#8221; ratings on both stocks, advising investors to pounce on any dip. Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) shares are also popping with a 3.6% gain after yesterday&#8217;s double-digit-percentage drop. President Trump has come out swinging against Tesla boycotters, announcing he would be buying an EV for himself in support of Elon Musk, whose net worth was slashed by $29 billion in yesterday&#8217;s market sell-off. Morgan Stanley analysts have reiterated their overweight rating on Tesla stock, calling the pullback in the stock a &#8220;buying opportunity.&#8221; With the exception of Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock, which is falling about 2%, each of the Mag 7 stocks started the day in the green. Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) is gaining 2.5% on the day after revealing it would begin charging customers for checked bags in a first for the airline. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 303.11 (-0.74%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 23.62 (+0.11%) S&amp;P 500: Down 20.02 (-0.34%) Key Points The markets are licking their wounds after yesterday&#8217;s historic sell-off. Nvidia&#8217;s gains are lifting tech boats. Tesla is also recovering with gains after a Wall Street endorsement. Market Movers Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) is testing an in-house chip for AI systems, sending the stock about 2% higher on the day. Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX) is gaining 2.6% on the day after growing subscribers by 24 million in H2 2024. Kohl&#8217;s (NYSE: KSS) stock is among the biggest losers today, falling over 16% on a disappointing profit and revenue outlook. Athletic apparel company Nike (NYSE: NKE) stock is falling 2% today despite a positive analyst note. Barclays analysts consider NKE stock an &#8220;equal weight&#8221; rating, saying that the &#8220;fundamental bottom&#8221; is near. Nike reports its quarterly results later this month.

    "title": "Bernard Arnault’s Brilliant Advice for Anyone Dreaming of Retirement One Day",
    "content": "If one visits almost any medium to large sized mall around the globe, certain luxury brand name stores or products tend to dominate, such as: Louis Vuitton Kenzo Fendi Sephora Tiffany Christian Dior Givenchy Dom Perignom Bulgari Guerlain ….and numerous others. All of these luxury brands and about 65 others all have a few things in common: they are high demand, top-dollar price tagged, and are all owned by LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton SE (OTC: LVMUY), the Paris, France headquartered luxury conglomerate helmed by Bernard Arnault. Arnault’s savvy management and focus on high-end, top of the line products has catapulted him into multibillionaire status, with a net worth that fluctuates between rivalling and even exceeding that of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, based on the stock price of LVMH at any given time. Despite the vast differences in the types of companies they find attractive and demographics of their respective customer bases for those companies, Arnault and Buffett share a “buy and hold” long term investment strategy mindset, and investors can find useful applications for several of the underlying rationales for how Arnault invests, even without the billions at his disposal. Key Points Both Warren Buffett’s and Bernard Arnault’s investing successes are based on a “buy and hold” strategy, although Berkshire Hathaway and LVMH could not be more unlike as corporate entities. In terms of stock price appreciation, Berkshire Hathaway has appreciated 2,800% over 30 years (1993-2023), while in the same time period, LVMH grew 100,000%. Although Arnault acquires a controlling interest in most of his companies like Buffett, there are underlying principles and rationales for his selections, which individual investors can also learn from and utilize. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Optimistic In The Long Term; Pessimistic In The Short Term Tiffany&#8217;s renowned reputation for premium jewelry and artistic craftmanship made it a must-have brand for LVMH to acquire. Whereas Warren Buffett characteristically pursues conservative companies with solid earnings that are undervalued, Arnault is much more aggressive, preferring high growth potential companies with high quality products that have underachieved through poor management or marketing. By investing in new designs and marketing, Arnault believes true value will eventually be achieved. Additionally, whereas Buffett’s modus operandi is to buy companies at bargain levels as low as possible to offset risk, Arnault has no qualms about paying a premium to acquire control over highly desired brands that he can then escalate even further. Buffett’s approach concentrates much more on intrinsic value and earnings and eschews hype or popularity, and is focused on solidly established industries, such as consumer goods, insurance, railroads, food, and banking. This explains Berkshire Hathaway’s late involvement in investing in technology. Conversely, Arnault’s focus on the luxury goods sector has helped LVMH to nearly corner the market on certain top brand couture, perfumes, champagnes, and accessories. That said, Arnault values diversification with synergy, as he has also branched out into related sectors like media and technology, especially if they can contribute to increasing value for his other holdings. While Arnault’s approach is unequivocally higher risk, the returns have been stellar. In a 30 year stretch from 1993 to 2023, Berkshire Hathaway stock grew 2,800%. In that same period, although much more volatile. LVMH grew 100,000%. Investing Tips for Retirees Berard Arnault&#8217;s acquisition selection principles can easily be applied to stock choices for one&#8217;s retirement portfolio. Bernard Arnault’s acquisition strategies are multimillion-dollar or even billion-dollar affairs. However, the underlying rationale for most of his acquisition choices are predicated on principles that will work to build any portfolio, and is something that retirees may especially wish to consider incorporating for their own stock picks: Quality Over Quantity &#8211; Some investors, especially Baby Boomers, are intimidated by the high prices of certain stocks, especially when they reach triple digits. However, if the investment is part of a growth portfolio, even 5 or 10 shares of a Magnificent 7 stock, such as Apple or Microsoft, will likely fare better than 100 shares of a company with more marginal upside potential. Look For Innovation &#8211; Companies that are not trying to innovate or who go on autopilot instead of investing in R&amp;D, will likely become stagnant over the long haul. The ones who are pushing the envelope will have a stronger chance for a big breakthrough, Think Globally &#8211; Arnault’s luxury brands have universal appeal in practically all contemporary societies, throughout all of the developed nations and emerging nations, to even Communist societies, where LVMH goods like Louis Vuitton handbags fetch enormous sums on the black market. Companies that market to the world as opposed to only a limited local market have a greater chance for long-term massive growth. On the topic of retirement, Arnault clearly loves what he does. He has led LVMH for 35 years and had the company’s by-laws for retirement extended twice, first to 80, and then to 85, when he himself reached age 76. His other advice to potential retirees would likely be to avoid it if you love what you’re doing.

    "title": "The Most Expensive Failed Startups of All Time",
    "content": "In the history of the business world, it should go without saying that far more companies fail than succeed. This is an unfortunate truth, with as many as 20% of new businesses failing in their first year, 50% within 5 years and 65% within 10 years. Only 35% of companies, or around one-third according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, can celebrate a ten-year mark. Key Points It&#8217;s an unfortunate truth that more startups fail than succeed. The hope is that you don&#8217;t expand too quickly without ensuring a solid business foundation. Sometimes, ideas are too early to market, as Webvan shows, as grocery delivery is now widespread. 4 million Americans are set to retire this year. If you want to join them, click here now to see if you’re behind, or ahead. It only takes a minute. (Sponsor) The most challenging point for some businesses, especially founders and CEOs, is that their failures are very public. It’s one thing to fail and disappoint yourself and your family, but it’s an entirely different thing to fail on a global scale, let go of employees, and see yourself in headlines worldwide. 10. Pets.com Founded: 1998 Defunct: 2000 Amount lost: $110 million Why it failed: An unsustainable business model based on too high shipping costs The Dot-Com Burst The poster child for the dot-com era going bust, Pets.com was a company born in 1998 and with its massive war chest of startup money, it looked to conquer the pet product delivery market. On the positive side, Pets.com saw an influx of customer activity and orders, but company management spent too much on advertising before the company was bringing in enough revenue. As a result, the company went defunct after just two short years and while it may not be the most expensive failed startup, it’s one of the most memorable. 9. Anki Founded: 2010 Defunct: 2019 Amount lost: $205 million Why it failed: High-profile promise that was unable to meet customer expectations Robots For All The promise of Anki was a welcome one as an American robotics and AI startup that manufactured small robots for children. After receiving over $200 million in investments, the hope was that robots like Cozmo and Vector had emotional intelligence, making them a more ideal play “toy” for children. Unfortunately, the company failed to secure its last round of financing and its only place on the market was a palm-size toy that provided gibberish chitchat with children. 8. Abound Solar Founded: 2007 Defunct: 2012 Amount lost: $614 million Why it failed: Unproven technology and high costs were too much for the solar industry Affordable Solar Panels One of two solar startups to rank among the most expensive failed startups of all time, Abound Solar lost its investors almost $614 million over five years. In an industry where price is everything, Abound Solar didn’t have the right technology or at least reliable enough technology to reduce costs low enough to meet customer demand. Separately, this company should be a lesson on not relying too heavily on government subsidies that don’t help businesses avoid marketplace realities. 7. Webvan Founded: 1996 Defunct: 2001 Amount lost: $800 million Why it failed: Didn’t have the correct scale to match an overly ambitious delivery rollout service Groceries To Your Door The idea of door-to-door grocery delivery is a fantastic one that hits all the right spots today with services like Instacart, Shipt, and Walmart+. However, before these services, Webvan tried out a similar business starting in 1999, but it expanded too fast without building up the right amount of demand. Unfortunately, it spent a ton of money without a solid customer base and profits to sustain its quick growth. In other words, Webvan should have tested demand in a few markets before expanding. 6. Theranos Founded: 2003 Defunct: 2018 Amount invested: $700 million &#8211; $1.4 billion Why it failed: Inaccurate and misleading claims about technology Total Fraud Arguably the best-known name on this list, Theranos has become something of the poster-child for failed startups. With hundreds of millions in investments from some of the world’s wealthiest families like the Waltons, Carlos Slim, Betsy Devos, and more, Theranos promised a revolutionary blood-test process. Unfortunately, the technology wasn’t real and the company that was at one time worth $9 billion went up in smoke leaving investors holding the bag on everything and its CEO in jail. 5. Jawbone Founded: 1999 Defunct: 2017 Amount lost: $900 million Why it failed: Failure to properly market and sell its products Not So Wearable Before the Apple Watch helped solidify the wearable market once and for all, Jawbone attempted to do the same thing. Established in 1999, the company was heavily focused on wearables, Bluetooth headphones, and wireless speakers. Venture capitalists poured money into the company, giving it a $3.2 billion evaluation at its peak, but the best Jawbone could manage was only capturing 3% of the market by 2015 before it wound itself down in 2017. 4. Better Place Founded: 2007 Defunct: 2013 Amount lost: $850 &#8211; $900 million Why it failed: Mismanagement, increasing infrastructure costs The Pre-Tesla An electric vehicle startup founded by entrepreneur Shai Agassi in 2007, Better Place was poised to look as big, if not bigger, than Tesla. Raising between $850 and $900 million in capital, the company looked to build battery-swapping stations so users could extend the range of their cars. Unfortunately, infrastructure costs were high and the company couldn’t keep operations going indefinitely. 3. Solyndra Founded: 2005 Defunct: 2011 Amount lost: $1.2 billion Why it failed: Could not compete with conventional solar panel manufacturers The Solar Flare Out One of the most heavily promoted startups of all time, Solyndra seemed so promising that even the Obama administration offered them $535 million in loans alongside $1.2 billion in private fundraising. Unfortunately, timing is everything in the startup world, and Solyndra’s timing couldn’t have been worse in 2011, as prices tanked for many of the materials it needed to make its panels. As a result, the company folded and the hope for widespread solar technology along with it. 2. LeSports Founded: 2014 Defunct: 2017 Amount lost: $1.7 billion Why it failed: LeSports faced financial mismanagement while overpaying for broadcasting rights Streaming Failures With an investment of $1.7 billion, LeSports was poised to dominate the Hong Kong sports streaming industry. Backed by a cadre of big investors, the company suffered from poor management and aggressive expansion that left it unable to pay rent on its buildings at one point. The biggest lesson here is to ensure a sustainable revenue model before going to market and not to expand too quickly without ensuring profitability first. 1. Quibi Founded: 2018 Defunct: 2020 Amount lost: $1.75 billion Why it failed: Niche, mobile-only content didn’t resonate with the audience Most Expensive Of All-Time Widely considered the most expensive failed start-up of all time, Quibi couldn’t have been in a better place to succeed. With more than $1.75 billion invested, two massively well-known entertainment and business co-founders, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman, the mobile-only short-form content didn’t resonate with audiences. Quibi was too early to market with 10-minute episodes. Unlike TikTok, which is creator-focused, Quibi was too close to traditional television, which was its ultimate downfall.

## Résultat

## 1. Macroéconomie

### Tendances Globales
Les tensions géopolitiques, exacerbées par les nouvelles vagues de tarifs imposées par les États-Unis, dominent l'actualité économique mondiale. Les craintes de récession s'intensifient, notamment aux États-Unis et en Europe, où les indicateurs de récession clignotent. La politique monétaire reste prudente, avec la Fed et d'autres banques centrales adoptant une approche attentiste face à l'incertitude économique.

### Scénarios Macro Probables

1. **Scénario de Récession Modérée (Probabilité élevée)**
   - **Causalité** : Les tarifs américains augmentent les coûts pour les entreprises, réduisant les marges et la consommation. La Fed maintient ses taux stables, mais pourrait envisager des réductions si l'économie se détériore davantage.
   - **Implications** : Baisse des actions, hausse des obligations souveraines, pression sur les matières premières.

2. **Scénario de Stabilisation Économique (Probabilité modérée)**
   - **Causalité** : Les négociations commerciales atténuent certaines tensions, stabilisant les marchés. Les banques centrales restent accommodantes.
   - **Implications** : Léger rebond des actions, stabilisation des obligations, reprise des matières premières.

3. **Scénario de Croissance Ralentissante (Probabilité faible)**
   - **Causalité** : Les tarifs sont partiellement levés, mais l'incertitude persiste. La consommation reste faible, mais l'investissement reprend légèrement.
   - **Implications** : Actions volatiles, obligations stables, matières premières en légère hausse.

## 2. Marchés

### Cycle Actuel
Les marchés sont en phase de correction, avec une forte volatilité due aux incertitudes tarifaires et aux craintes de récession. Les actions technologiques et bancaires sont particulièrement touchées.

### Pricing et Rotations Sectorielles
Les marchés anticipent une récession, ce qui se reflète dans la baisse des actions et la hausse des obligations. Les secteurs défensifs comme la consommation de base et la santé pourraient surperformer à court terme.

## 3. Secteurs

### Surperformance Attendue
- **Consommation de base** : Résilience face à la volatilité économique.
- **Santé** : Demande stable et moins exposée aux tensions tarifaires.

### Sous-performance Attendue
- **Technologie** : Impact direct des tarifs et de la volatilité des marchés.
- **Énergie** : Pression sur les prix du pétrole due aux craintes de récession.

## 4. Régions Clés

### États-Unis
- **Sous-performance** : Impact direct des tarifs, craintes de récession élevées.

### Europe
- **Sous-performance** : Exposition aux tensions commerciales et aux risques de récession.

### Asie
- **Volatilité élevée** : Impact des représailles tarifaires et des tensions géopolitiques.

### Émergents
- **Opportunités sélectives** : Certaines économies pourraient bénéficier de la diversification des chaînes d'approvisionnement.

## 5. Implications pour l'Investisseur

- **Actions** : Privilégier les secteurs défensifs, réduire l'exposition aux technologies.
- **Obligations** : Augmenter l'allocation aux obligations souveraines de qualité.
- **Matières Premières** : Surveillance accrue des prix du pétrole et des métaux précieux.

## 6. Anticipations vs Réalité

1. **Perception de la Récession** : Les marchés anticipent une récession plus sévère qu'elle ne pourrait être, créant des opportunités d'achat sélectives.
2. **Politique Monétaire** : Les attentes de réductions de taux sont peut-être trop optimistes à court terme.
3. **Impact des Tarifs** : L'impact des tarifs pourrait être surestimé dans certains secteurs, offrant des opportunités de valeur.

## Conclusion

### Convictions Majeures pour les 3 Prochains Mois

1. **Augmenter l'exposition aux obligations souveraines** pour se protéger contre la volatilité.
2. **Privilégier les secteurs défensifs** comme la consommation de base et la santé.
3. **Surveiller les opportunités d'achat sélectives** dans les actions technologiques sous pression.
