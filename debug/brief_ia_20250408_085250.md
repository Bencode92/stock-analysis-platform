Tu es un stratège senior en allocation d'actifs au sein d'une société de gestion de renom.

Tu reçois plusieurs types de données financières :
1. **Thèmes dominants** extraits de plus de 100 articles économiques (structurés par thème, région, secteur)
2. **Actualités à fort impact** (Top 100 globales, scorées par importance, en format synthétisé)
3. **Données marché actuelles** (indices, taux, spreads, etc.)
4. **Performances sectorielles récentes**

🎯 **Objectif** : Produire un **brief stratégique à destination d'un comité d'investissement**, clair, synthétique et orienté allocation.

---

🗓️ Nous sommes la semaine du 08 April 2025. Tu peux utiliser cette information temporelle pour contextualiser tes scénarios (FOMC, échéances, saison des résultats...).

---

🎓 **Tes missions** :

- Identifier les grandes **dynamiques macro, géopolitiques et sectorielles**
- Détailler **2 à 3 scénarios macro probables** à 3-12 mois, avec **leurs implications concrètes sur les classes d'actifs**
- Anticiper les **réactions probables des marchés** (prixant déjà certaines hypothèses)
- Détecter des **décalages perception / réalité** : où les marchés ou médias se trompent-ils ?
- Générer **des recommandations actionnables** sur l'allocation (secteurs, zones, classes d'actifs)
- Utiliser les données de marché et sectorielles comme points de repère factuels dans tes anticipations

---

📐 **Structure du brief attendue** :

1. **Macroéconomie** – Tendances globales, scénarios, causalité économique (ex : "Si X ⇒ alors Y ⇒ impact Z")
   - Pour chaque scénario, AJOUTE UN TITRE EXPLICITE, par exemple : 
     * Scénario 1 : "Récession modérée" (probabilité élevée)
     * Scénario 2 : "Stabilisation progressive" (probabilité moyenne)
     * Scénario 3 : "Rebond optimiste" (probabilité faible)

2. **Marchés** – Où en est-on dans le cycle ? Que price le marché ? Quelles rotations sectorielles probables ?

3. **Secteurs** – Surperformance / sous-performance attendue

4. **Régions clés** – États-Unis, Europe, Asie, Emergents : quelles zones sur / sous-performent ?

5. **Implications pour l'investisseur** – Synthèse claire avec recommandations (actions value ? matières premières ? obligations longues ?)

6. 🧠 **Anticipations vs Réalité** – Mets en évidence 2 ou 3 endroits où la perception du marché semble erronée, et ce que cela implique.

---

⚠️ **Niveau d'exigence** :

- Sois **stratégique et synthétique** (max ~800 tokens)
- Utilise des **chaînes de raisonnement** (pas seulement des constats)
- Distingue **court terme (1-3 mois)** vs **moyen terme (6-12 mois)**
- Intègre la **composante comportementale** : que price déjà le marché ? quelles attentes sont risquées ?
- IMPORTANT: En conclusion, inclure **3 convictions majeures avec une nuance temporelle claire**
  Par exemple: "Privilégier les obligations à long terme sur les 3 prochains mois en anticipation d'une baisse des taux dans le courant de l'été."

## Résultat

### 1. Macroéconomie

#### Scénario 1 : "Récession modérée" (probabilité élevée)
- **Contexte** : Les craintes de récession augmentent, alimentées par les tensions commerciales entre les États-Unis et la Chine. Les indicateurs de récession de la Fed envoient des signaux similaires à ceux de 2008. Les tarifs imposés par Trump exacerbent les pressions inflationnistes et pèsent sur la croissance économique.
- **Implications** : Les actions, en particulier dans les secteurs technologiques et financiers, devraient continuer à sous-performer. Les obligations à long terme pourraient bénéficier d'un mouvement vers la sécurité, mais les spreads de crédit pourraient s'élargir en raison de la montée des risques de défaut.

#### Scénario 2 : "Stabilisation progressive" (probabilité moyenne)
- **Contexte** : La Fed adopte une approche prudente, envisageant des baisses de taux si l'inflation montre des signes de ralentissement. La stabilisation pourrait être soutenue par des initiatives de relance en Chine et une éventuelle détente tarifaire.
- **Implications** : Les marchés actions pourraient connaître une reprise modérée, avec une rotation vers des secteurs défensifs comme les services publics et les biens de consommation de base. Les obligations pourraient voir une stabilisation des rendements à court terme.

#### Scénario 3 : "Rebond optimiste" (probabilité faible)
- **Contexte** : Une résolution rapide des tensions commerciales et une baisse significative des taux par la Fed stimulent la confiance des investisseurs. Les indicateurs économiques montrent une reprise de la croissance mondiale.
- **Implications** : Les actions, notamment dans les secteurs cycliques comme la technologie et l'industrie, pourraient surperformer. Les matières premières pourraient également bénéficier d'une reprise de la demande mondiale.

### 2. Marchés

- **Cycle actuel** : Les marchés sont dans une phase de correction, avec des indices américains comme le S&P 500 et le Dow Jones en baisse significative depuis le début de l'année. Le Nasdaq, bien que récemment en légère hausse, reste en territoire baissier.
- **Rotations sectorielles probables** : Une rotation vers les secteurs défensifs est probable à court terme, avec un intérêt accru pour les actions à dividendes et les obligations de qualité.

### 3. Secteurs

- **Surperformance attendue** : Les services publics et les biens de consommation de base devraient surperformer dans un environnement de récession modérée.
- **Sous-performance attendue** : Les secteurs technologiques et financiers, en particulier ceux exposés aux tensions commerciales, pourraient continuer à souffrir.

### 4. Régions clés

- **États-Unis** : Sous-performance probable en raison des tensions commerciales et des craintes de récession.
- **Europe** : Les banques européennes sont vulnérables, mais certains indices montrent des signes de reprise à court terme.
- **Asie** : La Chine pourrait bénéficier de mesures de relance, mais les tensions commerciales pèsent sur la région.
- **Émergents** : La volatilité reste élevée, avec des performances mitigées selon les pays.

### 5. Implications pour l'investisseur

- **Recommandations** :
  - **Court terme (1-3 mois)** : Privilégier les obligations à long terme et les actions défensives. Éviter les secteurs cycliques et les actions exposées aux tensions commerciales.
  - **Moyen terme (6-12 mois)** : Surveiller les opportunités dans les secteurs technologiques et industriels en cas de résolution des tensions commerciales.

### 6. Anticipations vs Réalité

- **Décalage 1** : Les marchés semblent sous-estimer la capacité de la Fed à intervenir agressivement si nécessaire. Cela pourrait offrir des opportunités d'achat sur les obligations à long terme.
- **Décalage 2** : Les tensions commerciales sont peut-être surévaluées dans leur impact à long terme sur la croissance mondiale, ce qui pourrait créer des opportunités dans les actions émergentes.
- **Décalage 3** : La perception d'une récession imminente pourrait être exagérée, surtout si des mesures de relance sont mises en œuvre rapidement.

### Conclusion

1. **Conviction 1** : Privilégier les obligations à long terme sur les 3 prochains mois en anticipation d'une baisse des taux dans le courant de l'été.
2. **Conviction 2** : Renforcer les positions dans les secteurs défensifs comme les services publics et les biens de consommation de base à court terme.
3. **Conviction 3** : Surveiller les opportunités d'achat dans les actions technologiques et industrielles en cas de détente des tensions commerciales.
